        <h1>Currency Inflation</h1>
        <p>The Currency Inflation page is where you define the percentage rate at which costs will go up over time. This can be applied to all of the currencies defined in the Currency Units  page.</p>
        <p>The Currency Inflation page works by selecting a Currency Exchange File defined in the Exchange File  page. Multiple Currency Exchange Files can be created, each with a unique set of configurable Currency Inflation time series data. This means that multiple inflation scenarios can be available for measures reporting and economic analysis.</p>

        <p>In the screen shot above you can see a dropdown menu. Simply use the dropdown menu to select a different set of Exchange File (as defined in the Currency Files page) for viewing and editing. Under each Exchange File selection, the user specify a different inflation schedule for each Currency Type, with each occupying one column.</p>
        <p>By typing a number into one of the cells, esi.manage will automatically populate the same number through all subsequent months and years until a new number is entered. Entered numbers appear in bold and automatically populated numbers appear in light grey.</p>
