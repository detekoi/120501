        <p>ValNav needs a working URL and Mapping File for the integration to connect successfully. This is a “set and forget” configuration piece, as once it is set up once, it shouldn’t need to be adjusted again. The setup of the mapping file would normally be completed by a 3esi consultant.</p>
        <p>To access the configuration, select Window&gt;Preferences&gt;ValNav Configuration. Here the ValNav Service URL and Mapping File can be defined.</p>
