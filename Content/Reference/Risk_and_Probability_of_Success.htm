            <MadCap:concept term="Risk and Probability of Success" />Dependency, Risk and Probability of Success</h1>
        <p>Dependency is a mechanism to relate one Measure to a particular Expenditure. 
 This is accomplished using the Dependencies Tab of a Project for Expenditure, 
 Production, Resource, and OPEX entries.</p>
        <p>Selecting a Dependent On expenditure will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforce 
 Date Rules</span>
            </li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">If End -&gt; Start 
 linkage is selected, the Start Date for the Measure will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">No 
 Earlier Than</span> the End Date of the previous measure.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">If Start -&gt; Start 
 linkage is selected, the Start Date for the Measure will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">No 
 Earlier Than</span> the Start Date of the previous measure</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets" style="font-weight: bold;">Calculate 
 NPD% and NPS% (Net Probability of Doing and Net Probability of Success)</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">NPD% and NPS% are calculated 
 based on 4 factors</li>
                <ol>
                    <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AF%</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Activity Factor)</span> – this is the 
 probability that the activity occurs and will cap the NPD% and NPS% for 
 all subsequent measures in the chain.</li>
                    <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OP%</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Outcome Probability)</span> – this is 
 the probability that once an activity is started, it will complete successfully.</li>
                    <li class="Bullets">Failure – If this 
 value is checked, the correlated expenditure will only occur when its 
 parent node in the dependency chain fails. Thus, any <span style="font-weight: bold;">AF%</span> 
 or <span style="font-weight: bold;">OP%</span> values entered for this 
 activity will only effect calculations if the parent entity fails.</li>
                    <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reset 
 NPD%</span> - If this value is checked, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">NPD%</span> 
 for that dependency chain is reset to 100% at that measure level.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are 3 primary reasons for utilizing Risk and/or Dependencies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Establishing 
 a <span style="font-weight: bold;">consistent Schedule</span> within a 
 Project. This prevents an Onstream Date being Forecast prior to the Completion.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Project <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comparison</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluation</span> 
 - it is a way of levelling two Projects - high risk and high production, 
 versus lower risk and less production.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Providing a more 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">accurate Forecast</span> of the company's 
 (business unit, asset team) plan for the coming year, or position at the 
 end of the year, since it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">unlikely</span> 
 that all activities will be successful (production impact) and not all 
 capital will be spent (Completion and Tie-In won't occur for a dry well).</li>

        <h3><a name="Probability_of_Doing"></a>Probability of 
 Doing (PD%) and Net Probability of Doing (NPD%)</h3>
        <p>When using Measure chains to 'calculate' the Probability of Success 
 for the various outcomes, it is necessary to <span style="font-weight: bold;">enter</span> 
 the AF% and/or OP% for each of the expenditures in the chain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">Generally the AF%/OP% for 
 a particular Expenditure will be the historical 'average' of similar activities 
 in a particular area. </li>
            <li class="Bullets">The AF% represents the 
 probability of successfully starting the item in the chain while the OP% 
 represents successfully completing the item in the chain. For example:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The AF% of the 
 Drill expense is 100% - it is planned to be done. Since it's the first 
 expenditure in the chain, it's <span style="font-weight: bold;">NPD%</span> 
 is 100%</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The OP% of the 
 Drill expense might be 80% - its likelihood of occurring is the average 
 success rate of drills in that area.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The NPD% and 
 NPS% of the Drill expense are 100% and 80% respectively.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The OP% of the 
 Completion expense might be 90%. This represents the historical success 
 rate of the Casing activity in that area.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The NPS% of the 
 Completion expense is 72% - &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">NPS%</span> 
 Drill x <span style="font-weight: bold;">OP%</span> Completion.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The OP% of the 
 Tie-In expense might be 100%. If the Completion activity begins, Tie-In 
 will as well.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The NPS% of the 
 Tie-In expense is also 72% - &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">NPS%</span> 
 Completion x <span style="font-weight: bold;">OP%</span> Tie-In.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Whenever a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Risked Expenditure</span> 
 value is being <span style="font-weight: bold;">calculated,</span> the 
 Gross Amount for the period is multiplied by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">current</span> 
 NPS% for the Expenditure.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Failure_State"></a>Branching Chains - the 
 Failure Case</h3>
        <p>Generally there are Abandonment costs associated with an unsuccessful 
 Drilling activity. This particular Expenditure is identified by the Negative 
 flag, and will be made Dependent on the most appropriate Expenditure in 
 the Chain (for example the Drill or the Case).</p>
        <p>The AF% of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">failure</span> Expenditure 
 will be 100% - its likelihood of occurring is captured in the historical 
 averages of the preceding expenditures. Since the 'failure' branch of 
 the chain is applicable only when Risk is being used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An Expenditure with a negative flag will only 
 be 'calculated' when a Risked (Gross or Net Risked) is selected for the 
 calculations.</li>
        </ul>
