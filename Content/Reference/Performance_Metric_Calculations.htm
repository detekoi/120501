        <p>Project Metrics can be calculated in four locations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Key Metrics 
 page of an individual Project.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Reports such 
 as Project Summary or Project Variance Summary</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">As a Ranking 
 Metric</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Economic Analysis as part of a Custom layout or Metrics tab</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Depending on where the Metric is calculated, there are different choices 
 available for the Horizon as well as Types and Definitions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Key 
 Metrics</span> - will always be calculated in both a Net Risked, and Net 
 Unrisked basis, over the Budget Period (Horizon). The Budget Units will 
 define in what units a particular Metric will be calculated in.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ranking</span> 
 - will be calculated using the specified Ranking Units. Values will always 
 be calculated on a Net Basis, using Blended numbers. Risk is an optional 
 modifier for any Metric.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reports</span> 
 have full configuration capabilities for Types and Definitions, as well 
 as the Units for the metric calculations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Budget Units</h3>
        <p>Metrics are presented in “<a href="../Configuration Perspective/Budget-Project/Budget_Fields.htm" target="_popup">Budget Units</a>” 
 as set in the Budget Configuration. Note this is distinct from reporting 
 units, which are always selectable. &#160;</p>
        <p>The product chosen serves as an equivalency, which production and reserves 
 are converted to. &#160;Appropriate 
 units for Production, Reserves, F&amp;D and Capital Efficiency are selected 
 when creating a new budget. &#160;</p>
        <p>These “Budget Units” are used when calculating performance metrics and 
 displayed as such in the Project Summary. &#160;For 
 example, when Canadian Dollars and barrels of oil are selected in the 
 Budget Configuration, F&amp;D is measured in Canadian dollars per barrel. 
</p>
        <p>See <a href="../Configuration Perspective/Budget-Project/Budget_Fields.htm">Budget Units</a></p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Metric Time Periods</h3>
        <p>In the metric calculation three different time periods are available:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">TB (B stands 
 for “Budget”) is the budget time period. &#160;Note 
 that a budget can be any arbitrary span of time, but is typically one 
 year. &#160;The 
 budget start and end date are set in configuration when creating a new 
 budget.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">TFS (FS stands 
 for “First Spend”) is a one year time period starting from the earliest 
 expenditure for a project.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">TOS (OS stands 
 for “First Onstream Date”) is a one year period starting from the earliest 
 product Onstream date for a project.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Earliest Project 
 Date</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">First Reserves 
 Booking</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">First Rig Release</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">First Spud</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">WI stands for 
 Working Interest</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">NPD stands for 
 Net Probability of Doing for Capital expenditures, Production, and OPEX.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">NPS stands for 
 Net Probability of Success for Capital expenditures, Production, and OPEX.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These different time periods are used to sum capital expenditures, reserves, 
 production and operating cost. &#160;Depending 
 on the metric, different time periods, and in some cases, multiple time 
 periods are used in calculating the metric. &#160;In 
 the following definitions, the time period is explicitly stated.</p>
