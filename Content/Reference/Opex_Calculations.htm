            <MadCap:concept term="Opex Calculations" />OPEX Calculations</h1>
        <p>There are three ways to Forecast operating Costs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed</span> 
 - a one time, or recurring expense that is not dependent on Production. 
 A Fixed OPEX entry can be related to a specific Product, which will influence 
 the calculated <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lifting Cost</span>.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable</span> 
 - expenses that are a function of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Production</span> 
 amount, such as processing, transmission or tariffs.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Price-Based</span> 
 - expenses that are a function of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Price Forecast</span> 
 amount, per the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Price Profile</span> and Product chosen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="Opex_Calculation_Modifiers"></a>OPEX 
 Modifiers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WI%</span> 
 - your company's share of the Operating Expense</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NPS%</span> 
 - the likelihood that the Expense will be realized. Generally this applies 
 to new wells, where the NPS% is the Likelihood that well will be successful.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are no 'specific' line item modifiers for Variable OPEX; WI%, 
 NPS% and Royalties (NRI%) will all be based on the values for the related 
 Production Segments.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Opex_Calculation_Periods"></a>Reporting 
 Period versus Data Period</h3>
        <p>All OPEX Entries (Fixed or Variable) have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start</span> 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">End Date</span>. These fields define:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">For Fixed OPEX: 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">valid</span> Period for the Expense, 
 and how to interpret the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gross Amount</span> 
 in terms of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Period</span>.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">For Variable 
 OPEX: the <span style="font-weight: bold;">valid</span> Period for the 
 Expense. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When OPEX calculations are requested (Reports, Analysis Cases, Ranking, 
 etc.), the Configuration defines a number of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculation 
 Periods</span>. Each&#160;Period 
 has a Start and End Date (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculation 
 Start</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculation End</span>), 
 and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculation Periodicity</span>. 
 </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Fixed_Opex_Calculation_Forecast"></a>Fixed 
 Operating Cost Calculations - Forecast</h3>
        <p>The following fields for a Fixed OPEX entry determine the calculated 
 Forecast OPEX for a particular Calculation Period. The key element that 
 influences the OPEX Calculations is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time 
 Period </span>which specifies how the Gross Amount is to be interpreted. 
 </p>
        <p>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> Time Periods, the Gross 
 Amount can be converted to an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Average 
 Daily Rate</span>. This is used when the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculation 
 Period</span> does not align with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Valid 
 Period</span> for the OPEX, or when the Calculation Periodicity is less 
 than Monthly.</p>
        <p>The Time Period choices are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NULL</span> 
 - the Gross Amount is a lump sum. It will be converted to an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Average 
 Daily</span> rate (based on the End Date - Start Date), . </li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daily</span> 
 - this is a Daily Rate.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weekly</span> 
 - the Gross Amount will be converted to an average Daily Rate, unless 
 the Calculation Periodicity is Weekly.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Monthly</span> 
 - if the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculation Periodicity</span> 
 is less than Monthly, the Gross Amount will be converted to an average 
 Daily Rate. </li>
            <ul>
                <li class="Bullets">If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Periodicity</span> 
 is Monthly or greater, the Gross Amount will be used as a Monthly amount; 
 i.e., if the Calculation Period is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quarterly</span>, 
 the OPEX will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">3 x Monthly Gross Amount</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quarterly</span> 
 - if the Calculation <span style="font-weight: bold;">Periodicity</span> 
 is less than Monthly, the Gross Amount will be converted to an average 
 Daily Rate. </li>
            <ul>
                <li class="Bullets">If the Calculation 
 Periodicity is Monthly, the Gross Amount will be divided by 3 (3 months/quarter). 
 </li>
                <li class="Bullets">If the Calculation 
 Periodicity is Annual, the Gross Amount will be multiplied by 4.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Annual</span> 
 - if the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Calculation Periodicity 
 is less than Monthly, the Gross Amount will be converted to an average 
 Daily Rate.</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="Bullets" style="font-weight: normal;">If 
 the Calculation Periodicity is Monthly or Quarterly, the Gross Amount 
 will be converted to either an average Monthly rate (divided by 12) or 
 a Quarterly Rate (divided by 4).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>The remaining fields that influence calculations are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date</span>, 
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">End Date</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration</span>- this defines the 
 Period that the entry is valid for. </li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Amount (per period)</span> - the Amount of the Expense</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Currency</span> 
 - the Currency Units for the entry. Based on the Currency units conversions, 
 the calculated amount will be converted from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Source</span> 
 to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Output</span> Units.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Forecast OPEX calculations can be Configured to apply an Escalation 
 file, in which case the calculated amount for a particular Calculation 
 Period is adjusted based on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Base 
 Currency Date</span> (part of the Budget), and the Currency Escalation 
 factors defined in the particular Escalation file.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Cost_Escalation.htm" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_popup">Currency Escalation</a></p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Variable_Opex_Calculation_Forecast"></a>Variable 
 Operating Cost Calculations - Forecast</h3>
        <p>The following fields for a Variable OPEX entry determine the calculated 
 Forecast OPEX. The key elements are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Amount</span> - the variable OPEX Rate ($/volume)</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Volume 
 Unit</span> - the Production Unit (volume) for the Rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Asset and Product selections for the Variable OPEX entry identifies 
 which Production Segments provide the Forecast Production amounts. The 
 calculated Production volume (in the Variable OPEX volume unit) will be 
 used to determine the OPEX amount. &#160;If 
 Product is left blank, then all production associated with the asset is 
 converted to an equivalence unit and the OPEX amount will be calculated 
 on the total production in that equivalence unit.</p>
        <p>The remaining fields that influence calculations are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date</span>, 
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">End Date</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration</span> - this defines the 
 Period that the entry is valid for. Production which occurs outside of 
 the valid period will have no calculated OPEX.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Currency</span> 
 - the Currency Units for the entry. Based on the Currency units conversions, 
 the calculated amount will be converted from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Source</span> 
 to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Output</span> Units.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See <a href="Cost_Escalation.htm" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_popup">Currency Escalation</a></p>
        <p>Forecast OPEX calculations can be Configured to apply an Escalation 
 file, in which case the calculated amount for a particular Calculation 
 Period is adjusted based on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Base 
 Currency Date</span> (part of the Budget), and the Currency Escalation 
 factors defined in the particular Escalation file.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Opex_Calculations_Actuals"></a>Operating 
 Costs - Actuals</h3>
        <p>All 'Actuals' are represented as Fixed OPEX entries. Typically these 
 entries have been brought into the Project via an Import process resulting 
 in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start</span> 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">End Dates</span> - Jun 1, 2010 to 
 Jun 30, 2010</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gross 
 Amount</span> - 10000</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WI%</span> 
 - 85% (whatever is appropriate for the particular Cost Center or Well)</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Type</span> 
 - All Operating Costs (or any other OPEX Type)</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product</span> 
 - optional (can be set for Lifting Cost calculations)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Generally the Time Period is NULL as the Actuals entry represents a 
 lump sum for the given period. If a Time Period is selected for a particular 
 entry, the calculation methodology described in <a href="#Fixed_Opex_Calculation_Forecast" style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed 
 OPEX</a> calculations is applied.</p>
        <p>Operating Expenses utilizes the Definitions, Types and Blending logic 
 for Production.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="Opex_Calculations_Lifting_Cost"></a>Lifting 
 Cost Calculations</h3>
        <p>The Lifting Cost (Dollar/volume) calculation is accessible as a Project 
 Metric, and is an optional reporting form for OPEX Reports. The basic 
 form of the calculation is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dollar 
 / Volume</span> = <span style="font-weight: bold;">OPEX Amount</span> 
 / <span style="font-weight: bold;">Production</span> (in selected volume 
 units)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixed OPEX (Forecast and Actuals) can <span style="font-weight: bold;">optionally</span> 
 be associated with a specific product, while for Variable OPEX the product 
 association is mandatory.</p>
        <p>When a Product has been identified for an OPEX entry, the corresponding 
 Product's production is used in the calculation. </p>
