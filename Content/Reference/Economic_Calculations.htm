        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>These terms will be used in the following description:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Income 
 Tax</span> – a % that is applied to determine the Tax owed. This is referred 
 to in the following description as Local Tax or Government Tax.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Production</span> 
 or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Tax</span> – defined against 
 individual Product’s Production or Revenue. </li>
            <ul>
                <li class="Bullets">These are referred 
 to in the following description as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Production/Revenue 
 Tax</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Production 
 taxes</span> are expressed as $ / volume and are independent of the Price 
 File being used to calculate Cash Flow.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue 
 taxes</span> are expressed as a % and are dependent on the Price File 
 being used to calculate Cash Flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Analysis Case uses the term "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cash 
 Flow Tag</span>" to represent calculation points in the Cash Flow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Net 
 Revenue (NRev)</span> – Revenue less Operating Expenses</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Net 
 Net Revenue (NNRev)</span> – Net Revenue less Local Production/RevenueTax</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Before 
 Tax (BTax)</span> – Net Net Revenue less CAPEX</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">After 
 Tax (ATax)</span> – Net Net Revenue less (Local Tax, Government Production/Revenue 
 Tax, Depreciation, Government Tax and CAPEX)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Discounting</h3>
        <p>The cash flow table that is generated is based on a monthly periodicity. 
 In terms of the discounting calculations, these amounts are treated as 
 if they occur at the end of the month. </p>
        <p>The Annual Rate will be used for any Period whose Discounting is Annual. 
 There is the option to select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Monthly 
 Discounting</span> for some period of the Analysis Horizon.</p>
        <p>If Monthly Discounting is being used for a particular period, the Effective 
 Monthly Discount Rate is calculated as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effective 
 Monthly Discount Rate</span> = (1 + Annual Rate)^<span style="vertical-align: Super;">(1/12)</span> 
 - 1</p>
        <p>For example, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">15%</span> Annual Discount 
 Rate converts to an Effective Monthly Rate of <span style="font-weight: bold;">~1.1715%</span></p>
        <p>The Discounting that is applied to a particular period is based on the 
 Discount Rate (Effective Monthly or Annual) and the number of Discount 
 Periods. Again, the Number of Discount Periods is dependent on the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../PopUp/UI_Anyls_Settings.htm" target="_popup">Display / Discounting</a></span> 
 settings.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For Annual Discounting</span>:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Number of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
 Discount Periods</span> = (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year</span> <span style="vertical-align: Sub;">Current Period</span> - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Year</span><span style="vertical-align: Sub;"> Economic Discounting As Of Date</span>) 
 + (12 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Month</span><span style="vertical-align: Sub;">Economic 
 Discounting As Of Date</span> )/12</p>
        <p class="example"><b>eg.:</b> with Discount As Of Date of 
 Dec 31, 2009, any period in 2013 will have a value of 4 for the number 
 of Discount Periods. Even if the Display Setting is Monthly, if Annual 
 Discounting has been selected for that particular period, the number of 
 Discount Periods will be 4 for all monthly entries within 2013.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">If you have selected an Economic Discount 
 Date somewhere other than the end of a year, the formula above accounts 
 for the 'mid-year' transition.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Monthly 
 Discounting</span> has been selected:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Number of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
 Discount Periods</span> = (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Serial Month</span> <span style="vertical-align: Sub;">Current Period</span> - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Serial 
 Month</span><span style="vertical-align: Sub;"> Economic Discounting As 
 Of Date</span>) </p>
        <p>effectively the number of Months between the Current Period and the 
 Economic Discount Date.</p>
        <p>The Mid Year option is only applicable to Periods that have Annual Discounting 
 (the Mid-Period correction will never be applied to a period with Monthly 
 Discounting).</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of 
 Discount Periods</span><span style="vertical-align: Sub;"> Mid Year</span> 
 &#160;= <span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of Discount Periods</span><span style="vertical-align: Sub;">Annual 
 Discounting</span> - 0.5</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The calculation of a Discounted Value is:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discounted 
 Amount</span> = <span style="font-weight: bold;">Amount</span> * ( 1 / 
 (1 + <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discount Rate</span>) ^ (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Number 
 of Discount Periods</span>) )</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0px;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Economic Metrics</h3>
        <p>Each <a href="../Configuration Perspective/Economics/Default_Economic_Metrics.htm" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_popup">Metric</a> 
 is associated with a specific <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cash Flow 
 Tag</span> (one of the list above), which specifies the ‘point’ in the 
 Cash Flow calculations that is used in the Metric. In the following descriptions 
 of the Metric, the term Cash Flow Tag will mean any of the above list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Horizon</span> 
 – the period which is covered by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start 
 Date</span> (either Point Forward Date or Full Cycle First Spend) plus 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Span</span></li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cumulative 
 CAPEX (∑ CAPEX)</span> – the total CAPEX which is captured over 
 the Horizon</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cumulative</span> 
 Net Revenue / Before Tax / Net Net Revenue / After Tax (∑NRev, ∑NNRev, 
 ∑Btax, ∑BTax) – corresponding cumulative amounts of these 
 Tags</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Metrics can be configured at a different Discount Rate than what is 
 being used for the Analysis Case itself. The other properties of the Analysis 
 Case (Discounting Schedule, Economics As Of Date, etc.) are used to generate 
 the corresponding Discounted Cash Flow (if it is a Discounted Metric) 
 for the Metric. </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>IRR – Internal Rate of Return</h3>
        <p>The Internal rate of return is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discount 
 Rate</span> which will result in <span style="font-weight: bold;">NPV 
 = 0</span>.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Economic Limit</h3>
        <p>The Economic Limit is defined as the point in time when the periodic 
 Cash Flow goes from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Positive</span> to 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Negative</span>. </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Payout" />Payout</h3>
        <p>The Payout is the date when the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cumulative 
 Cash Flow</span> (at the chosen Cash Flow Tag) equals the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cumulative 
 CAPEX</span> captured over the entire <span style="font-weight: bold;">Horizon</span>.</p>
        <p>The Payout start date is defined as the later of the project start date and the <MadCap:keyword term="point-forward" />point-forward date defined in an Analysis Case.</p>
        <p>When creating a Payout metric there is a flag to <b><MadCap:keyword term="Interpolate Date" />Interpolate Date</b>. This option allows for an interpolation of when the Payout occurred, and will calculate the Payout to a specific date. When a start date occurs on any day of the month other than the first and date interpolation is on, the month’s value will be reduced proportionately.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Custom Metric</h3>
        <p>Custom economic metrics allow the user to specify a formula as a metric calculation. The formula is a simple NUM / DENOM, where NUM and DENOM are sums of cashflow columns, where each column can be separately filtered</p>
        <p>The usual metrics NPV, PIR, DPIR, ROI, DROI can be defined as a custom metric. As information, the metrics calculation are referenced below.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>NPV - Net Present Value</h3>
        <p>Net Present Value at the specified Analysis Case Discount Rate is reported as the Cumulative Discounted Cash Flow at a particular level (i.e., Asset or Project).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The NPV Metric is defined as: ∑ Discounted "Cash Flow Tag"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Additional NPV metrics can be added which repeat the Cash Flow Discounting calculations at a different Discount Rate and report the cumulative value as described above as the NPV at that rate.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Profit to Investment Ratio (PIR)</h3>
        <p>The Profit to Investment Ratio (<span style="font-weight: bold;">PIR</span>) 
 is defined as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">PIR = (∑”CashFlowTag” + ∑ CAPEX) 
 / ∑ CAPEX</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Discounted Profit to Investment Ratio (DPIR)</h3>
        <p>The Discounted Profit to Investment Ratio (DPIR) is defined as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">DPIR = (∑Discounted ”CashFlowTag” + 
 ∑ Discounted CAPEX) / ∑ Discounted CAPEX</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Return on Investment (ROI)</h3>
        <p>The Return on Investment (<span style="font-weight: bold;">ROI</span>) 
 is defined as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">ROI = ∑”Cash Flow Tag” / ∑ CAPEX</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Discounted Return on Investment &#160;(DROI)</h3>
        <p>The Discounted Return on Investment (DROI) is defined as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">DROI = ∑ Discounted “Cash Flow Tag” 
 / ∑ Discounted CAPEX</p>
