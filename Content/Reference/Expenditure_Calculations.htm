        <p>An Expenditure is Forecast using 3 fields:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start 
 Date</span> - when the activity is forecasted to begin.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">End 
 Date</span> - when the activity is forecasted to complete</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gross 
 Amount</span> - the Total amount of the Expenditure</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Start to End Dates are termed the Forecast Period. In terms of the 
 'duration':</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">the Start Date is interpreted 
 as occurring at 12:00:00 AM.</li>
            <li class="Bullets">the End Date is interpreted 
 as occurring at 11:59:59 PM</li>
            <li class="Bullets">As a result, an Expenditure 
 with the same start and end dates has a duration of 1 day.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Expenditure_Schedule"></a>Expenditure Schedule/Details</h3>
        <p>Associated with each Expenditure is a 'Forecast Schedule'. This is the middle table on the Expenditure page. The schedule 
 entries will be initialized based on the duration of the Expenditure. 
 For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">An Expenditure 
 with a 1 year duration will be distributed equally over 12 monthly Schedule 
 Entries (first of month, last of month)</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">An Expenditure 
 that covers multiple years will be distributed equally over yearly entries.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">An Expenditure 
 with a 1 month duration will have a single entry for the entire amount.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">An Expenditure 
 with less than 1 month duration will be distributed into weekly (7 day) 
 entries, based on an average daily rate (Gross Amount/duration. If there 
 is a resultant schedule period less than 7 days, the Gross Amount for 
 that period will be the number of days x the daily rate.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">If the Forecast 
 Period overlaps a month end, there will be Schedule entry for each month. 
 The number of days within each month will determine the allocation of 
 the Gross Amount.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">If the Forecast 
 Period covers multiple months, entries will be created for each month, 
 with the Gross Amount being distributed based on the number of days within 
 any period.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Expenditure Details are Editable, and there is a feature to Expand 
 entries into smaller duration entries, i.e., a yearly Schedule Entry can 
 be expanded into Quarterly or Monthly entries. This is an unidirectional change. If the expected capital 
 spend is non-uniform over the period, the schedule can be adjusted to 
 better represent the capital profile, as well as facilitate tracking.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of an expenditure &amp; associated expenditure schedule over a one year period.</p>

        <h3><a name="Periodic_Expenditure_Calculations"></a>Expenditure 
 Calculations</h3>
        <p>All Expenditure (CAPEX) Forecast calculations are based on the corresponding 
 Schedule entry(s) for the period in question. How the schedule information 
 is used is dependent on 3 factors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Date Range 
 for the calculations.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The periodicity 
 of the calculations (monthly, quarterly, annual).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Last Actuals 
 Date (if Blending is being used).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The combination of Date Range and Periodicity will not always align 
 with the Schedule of the Expenditures. For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">An Expenditure 
 has 4 Schedule Entries: Jan 3 to Jan 9, Jan 10 to Jan 16, Jan 17 to Jan 
 23 and Jan 24 to Jan 26.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">A weekly Report 
 (12 period) is being generated, starting on Jan 1, which results in the 
 following periods starting: Jan 1, Jan 8, Jan 15, Jan 22, Jan 29, Feb 
 4, Feb 11, etc.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Each of the Schedule 
 Entries has an average daily rate (Gross Amount for the period / duration).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">This daily rate 
 is used in conjunction with the number of days that it has within a given 
 reporting period. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="example"><b>e.g.:</b> 
 the first Schedule period (Jan 3 to Jan 9) has 5 days within reporting 
 period 1, and 2 days within reporting period 2.</p>
        <p>The second 
 reporting period (beginning on Jan 8) is made of 2 days of Schedule Entry 
 1, and 5 days of Schedule Entry 2.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="Blended_Expenditure_Calculations"></a>Blended 
 Calculations</h3>
        <p>For Blended calculations, there is an additional degree of division:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Last Actuals 
 Date separates the data calculations into two portions.</li>
            <ol>
                <li class="NumberedList">Calculation 
 Start to Last Actuals Date (interpreted as an End Date)</li>
                <li class="NumberedList">Last Actuals 
 Date + 1 to Calculation End.</li>
            </ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Within Period 
 1, only Expenditure Data of Type Actuals is considered. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Within Period 
 2, Forecast Data is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Capital Actual entries are represented in the same manner as the Capital 
 Forecast Schedule - Start and End Date, and Amount. The principles described 
 above about calculating a Daily Rate (based on an Entry Period) and using 
 this value in conjunction with a particular Calculation Period applied 
 to both Actuals and Forecast entries. The Last Actuals Date simply introduces 
 an additional transition date. </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Expenditure_Calculation_Modifiers"></a>Expenditure 
 Modifiers</h3>
        <p>There are two Modifiers that are used in Expenditure Calculations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">WI% - used for Net Basis 
 calculations.</li>
            <li class="Bullets">Risk - used for Risked 
 calculations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See <a href="Risk_and_Probability_of_Success.htm#Probability_of_Doing" target="_popup">Risk</a></p>
        <p>Risk is described by the AF% and OP% values in the <a href="../Dependencies/Dependencies.htm">Dependencies</a> tab. Note that by definition Actuals or Field Estimates have 
 100% probability.</p>
        <p>Working Interest is inherited from Ownership for each Expenditure Schedule 
 entry, Forecast, Field Estimates and Actuals. As indicated above, Expenditure 
 Calculations are based on the data contained within the Schedule table(s). 
 If a Net calculation is being requested, it will be based on the Net Amounts 
 for the individual schedule entries, within the context of the Dates logic 
 described above. </p>
