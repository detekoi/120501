            <MadCap:concept term="Currency Escalation" />Currency Escalation Configuration</h1>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Escalation</span> is a way to 
 represent future costs (Expenditures, OPEX, Prices) based on amounts entered 
 in today's "dollars". </p>
        <p>There are 3 parts to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">configuration</span> 
 of Escalation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Budget <span style="font-weight: bold;">Base Currency Date</span> - this sets the Date 
 that the Escalation Factors are defined against. A Base Currency Date 
 of Jan 1, 2010 means that monetary amounts have been entered in 2010 "dollars".</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Currency 
 Escalation File</span> - multiple files can be created to enable evaluation 
 of Projects under a number of different scenarios. An Escalation file 
 contains Measure Currency Escalation entries as described below. In order 
 to apply Escalation to calculations, an Escalation file must be selected.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Measure 
 Currency Escalation</span> - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Annualized</span> 
 percentages defined for each CAPEX Category, and OPEX and Resources, on 
 a Jurisdiction by Jurisdiction basis.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A new Currency Escalation file is created by selecting the <img src="../Images/index_add.png" /> button. You will be prompted to provide a File name which 
 can be referenced when you want Escalation applied to esi.manage calculations. 
 See <a href="Cost_Escalation.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Escalation Calculations</a> 
 for a more detailed description of how the supplied values are used in 
 calculations.</p>
        <p>Data is entered by Jurisdiction, in a particular escalation file, for a specific measure. Each Capex type will be available for its own escalation rate, Opex is available as a single option (cannot have different escalation rates for different Opex types), and Price is also available as a single field (cannot have different escalation rates for different products).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Escalation Table <span style="font-weight: bold;">propagates</span> 
 user entered values for all time periods into the future, until another 
 user supplied value (by measure) is encountered.</p>
        <p>There is an option to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duplicate</span> 
 an Escalation file, keeping much of the data the same and only modifying 
 a select number of entries.</p>
