        <h2>
            <MadCap:concept term="Production Calculations" />Production Calculations</h2>
        <p>There are two approaches to represent the Production Forecast for a 
 particular well(s).</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Formulaic</span> 
 - based on an Initial Production (IP, or Qi) rate, Decline Type (e.g. Linear, Hyperbolic, Exponential, or Harmonic) and Parameters, 
 Onstream Date, and Offstream Date or Rate.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tabular</span> 
 - a series of entries (typically monthly) that represents the average 
 daily rate for the period.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are a number of Segment Level Modifiers that can be applied to 
 the calculated Production, depending on the particular needs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WI%</span> 
 - this represents your company's Net Production.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrinkage</span> 
 - the Shrinkage % represents 'losses'; which may be due to Derived Product(s) 
 (see below), line losses, or consumption for compression. This factor 
 is represented in Production Calculations via the Raw versus Sales Production 
 definition.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NRI%</span> 
 - this factor (Net after Royalties) combines the Working Interest and 
 Royalty % into a single value. Unlike Royalties or Production Tax, there 
 is no Time basis to this factor. If NRI% is supplied, it takes precedence 
 over any time based Royalty percentages.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality</span> 
 - a factor that can adjust the calculated Production in terms of actual 
 heating value (for Gas), or Density (for liquids).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In addition to the modifiers listed above, there are a number of options 
 that can impact Production Calculations.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Derived 
 Products</span> - a Production segment can be defined as being Derived 
 from a Primary Product. The Production for this segment will be a ratio 
 (constant or time variant) of the Primary Product's production.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Royalties</span> 
 - every Asset/Product combination can have time series' of Royalty % specified. 
 Three series are available (Low, Medium, High or P10, P50, P90). The names 
 of the individual series is configurable.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Downtime</span> 
 - Unscheduled and/or Scheduled downtime can be defined for the Asset (well). 
 With the exception of the Production Analysis screen, all other Production 
 related calculations (this includes calculations that are based on Production, 
 such as Variable OPEX or Revenue) will be after Downtime.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Curtailment</span><span> 
 - this is a set of capabilities for modelling the effects of constraints 
 on production at a group level, such as the constraints a facility places 
 on a producing field.</span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>And finally, Production based taxes can be configured at a Jurisdiction 
 level to support Economics Calculations.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Production 
 Tax</span> - a certain percentage of a Product's Production is removed 
 as a Tax. Revenue calculations are then performed against the 'removed' 
 Production to determine the corresponding Tax.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue 
 Tax</span> - a dollar / volume tax. This is independent of the corresponding 
 Product Price, but is related to the Production.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="Heating_Value_and_Density_Conversions1"></a>Quality 
 - Heating Value or Density</h3>
        <p>A given Production stream can be reported in two ways, depending on 
 the Product Category:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gas</span> 
 - Volumetric or Energy</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Gas 
 (Liquid or Other)</span> - Volumetric or Mass</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Generally, a production segment will be Forecast in volumetric units 
 (Gas in mcf/day, Liquids in bbl/day). However, Price Files (for calculation 
 of Revenue) are often defined in Heating Value (for Gas) or Mass (for 
 Liquids). Each Product has a default Quality (entered in the Configuration), 
 and every Production Segment has data Fields for specifying the particular 
 Quality of the well.</p>
        <p>In addition, there are Equivalence Units which allow for cross category 
 reporting - for example Reporting the entire production in terms of a 
 Gas (mcfe) or Liquid (boe). These units will only have a "notional" 
 representation of Quality - for example a GJe unit would be based on a 
 "standard" Heat Content for both Gas and Non-Gas.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Conversion infrastructure is based on the SI system:</p>
        <p>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gas</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">Volumetric Base - <span style="font-weight: bold;">m3</span> (cubic metres). This is identified 
 in the Configuration as m3 (energy)</li>
            <li class="Bullets">Energy Base - <span style="font-weight: bold;">J</span> 
 (joules)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Gas</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">Volumetric Base - <span style="font-weight: bold;">m3</span> (cubic metres). This is identified 
 in the Configuration as m3 (mass)</li>
            <li class="Bullets">Mass Base - <span style="font-weight: bold;">kg</span> 
 (kilograms)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Input</span> is only allowed in 
 an appropriate unit - i.e.:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">A Gas segment can only 
 be defined in either <span style="font-weight: bold;">Volumetric</span> 
 (mcf, mmcf, e3m3 (G)), or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy</span> 
 (btu, mbtu, GJ) basis.</li>
            <li class="Bullets">A Liquid (Oil, NGLs) segment 
 can only be defined in either <span style="font-weight: bold;">Volumetric</span> 
 (bbl,m3, e3m3 (L)), or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mass</span> (T, 
 kT) basis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equivalence Units</span> (boe, mcfe, 
 GJe, etc.) can be defined in the Configuration to allow conversion between 
 Product Categories (i.e., reporting Gas in a Liquid Equivalence unit). 
 The values entered represent the conversion to <span style="font-weight: bold;">boe</span>, 
 i.e.; <span style="font-weight: bold;">1 mcfe</span> = <span style="font-weight: bold;">0.16667 
 boe</span>.</p>
        <p>Production Calculations which report in non-native units (for example 
 when reporting both Gas and Liquid), can only be reported using an Equivalence 
 Unit.</p>
        <p>There are several recognized "Standards" which specify Conversion 
 Factors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">For Gas the reference 
 state is dependent on whether the Imperial or SI system is being used 
 as the standard.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The "Base" 
 energy content (BTU/cf) of a Gas has a variety of values.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Similarly, the 
 reference density for Oil can vary.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The only "guidance' is to ensure that a consistent set of inter-conversions 
 are entered.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Default <span style="font-weight: bold;">Product Qualities</span> are 
 user defined conversion factors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Description 
 is a user defined label.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Only one conversion 
 factor can be supplied for each entry: to the base Heating Value definition 
 (J/m3) or base Density definition (kg/m3).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The entries in 
 this table are what are available in the Product Definition table, as 
 well as the individual Production Segments.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Individual Products are defined in terms of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bookable</span> 
 - whether the Product is to participate in metric (Lifting Cost, F&amp;D) 
 calculations.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy</span> 
 - indicates whether the Quality is to be represented in Energy or Mass 
 units.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Units/boe, 
 Unit</span> &#160;- 
 the Base unit for the particular Product and its conversion to the base 
 Equivalence Unit (boe).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Quality conversions represent the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Default</span> 
 relationship. For each Product the conversion is represented as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality 
 Unit</span>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">For "Gas" 
 products (the Energy flag will be true), the Quality will be represented 
 in a Heating Value unit defined as per Product Qualities (above).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">For "Non-Gas" 
 products (the Energy flag will be false), the Quality will be represented 
 in a Density unit defined as per Product Qualities (above).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Each Production segment will use the corresponding Product Default Quality, 
 however, it can be overridden. </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Forecast_Production"></a>Forecast Production 
 - Periodic</h3>
        <p>All <span style="font-weight: bold;">Forecast</span> related Production 
 calculations begin with the determination of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gross 
 Cumulative Production</span> for a particular period. All Production calculations 
 require a Production period (Start Date to End Date), which has generally 
 been specified by the client (Reports, Analysis Screens, Economics, Ranking, 
 etc.) of the calculations. &#160;The 
 client configuration determines the Start and End Date for the various 
 periods being requested (i.e., Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">esi.manage uses the actual 
 number of days in a given period for its calculations. For example, if 
 monthly calculations are requested, January will be based on 31 days of 
 production and February 28 (or 29). A Production Graph will appear somewhat 
 jagged based on the number of days in a particular month.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daily 
 Production Rates</span> are determined by dividing the Cumulative Production 
 by the number of days in the Period. This will smooth out the Production 
 Profile.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets">esi.manage uses the Effective 
 Decline rate formulation of the various Formulaic Decline methods. If 
 your source data is represented as a Nominal Decline, it must be converted 
 to the Effective Decline form.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">The Decline Interval 
 can be Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly or Annual. For Production calculations 
 these are converted to a Daily decline rate.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">Monthly decline intervals 
 are converted based on 30.4375 days/month</li>
                <li class="Bullets">Quarterly decline intervals 
 are based on 91.3125 days/quarter</li>
                <li class="Bullets">Annual decline intervals 
 are based on 365.25 days/year.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets">Production Declines from 
 the first day. </li>
            <li class="Bullets">Tabular Production is held 
 within esi.manage as the Average Daily Production for the period. The 
 cumulative Production is determined by multiplying this value by the number 
 of days in the calculation period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Production Segment Onstream Date can occur on anywhere in the month. 
 For example, if the Forecast OnStream date is May 25, 2011, the Cumulative 
 Production for May will be based on 7 days (May 25 to May 31).</p>
        <p>Production can be calculated up to the Offstream 'point'. This is determined 
 from the calculated end date of a formulaic curve, or the end of entered 
 tabular data.</p>
        <p>The Total Cumulative Production for a particular segment is based on 
 the period from the Onstream Date to the Offstream Date. This is the value 
 that will be used to initialize the Gross Technical Reserves amount.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Production Downtime"></a>Production 
 Downtime</h3>
        <p>Production Downtime can be expressed in two forms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unscheduled</span> 
 - this is a % that represents the anticipated service factor for a particular 
 'well', expressed as the % of time that the well will be non-producing. 
 For example, a well that has historically produced 75% of the time will 
 have an unscheduled downtime % of 25.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scheduled</span> 
 - this is used to reflect 'known' downtime periods at some time in the 
 future. Each Scheduled downtime entry has a Start and End Date, and a 
 Downtime % for that period. The Downtime % represents the anticipated 
 reduction - for example if a Facility will be running at 60% capacity 
 for a particular period, the corresponding Scheduled Downtime will be 
 40%.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Multiple overlapping downtime entries are applied in a sequential order, by default, resulting in a multiplicative result.  Unscheduled downtime is applied first, followed by scheduled downtime.  In this manner, 50% unscheduled downtime and 50% scheduled downtime in the same period will result in 25% production (100*50% = 50%, then 50*50% = 25%)</p>
        <p>Production models may assume that product is 'lost' during downtime, as opposed to an extension of the life of a well. To support such models, esi.manage allows the user to discard downtime production. This option can be toggled within the Configuration perspective (System -&gt;Miscellaneous-&gt;Site-specific features&gt;Nonstandard Downtime).  Enabling this feature will also calculate downtime in an additive manner (ie. 50% scheduled and 50% unscheduled downtime will have zero production in that period).</p>
        <p>Beyond these points, Forecast Production values used or displayed (with 
 one exception) within esi.manage are <span style="font-weight: bold;">After 
 Downtime </span>has been applied. The Production Analysis view will display 
 Forecast values with and without Downtime applied.</p>
        <p>Production Actuals are a result of any real Downtime, the configured 
 Downtime percentages are not applied to Actuals.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Production_Definitions"></a>Production 
 Definitions</h3>
        <p>The following table shows how the various Modifiers described above 
 are applied to calculated Forecast Production (<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="#Production Downtime">after Downtime</a></span>).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/Prod_Defns.png" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>With the exception of Royalties (which utilize a Time Series), all other 
 modifiers are single values that are applied to the calculated Forecast 
 Amount.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Note that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Actuals</span> (Field Estimates, Actuals and 
 Financial Actuals) only occur after a Well is producing.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Actuals have 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">0 Risk</span> (POS is 100%), are presumed 
 to be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrunk</span> (no Shrinkage will 
 be applied), and reflect any actual <span style="font-weight: bold;">Down 
 Time</span>.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Actuals are presumed 
 to reflect the Royalties or NRI%, and contain the corresponding Revenue 
 generated from the Production.</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">NRI%, Royalties 
 and Price Files <span style="font-weight: bold;">will not</span> be applied 
 to 'Actuals' production data.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>In terms of the data entered for these modifiers (and their impact on 
 the reported production):</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WI%</span> 
 is applied directly. A Net number will be the Gross Production x the WI%.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Risk</span> 
 is derived from dependencies in the Project. A Risked production amount 
 will be the Gross (or Net) Production x NPS%. &#160;If 
 Production is not dependent on another measure, you can enter an AF% to 
 get the NPS% for the production segments %.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrinkage</span> 
 is accounted for with the Sales definitions; which will be the Production 
 Amount (Gross or Net, Risked or Unrisked) x (1 - Shrinkage).</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NRI%</span> 
 is applied directly, however, it is presumed to include the WI% as part 
 of its value. If NRI% has been supplied for a Production Segment, the 
 WI% <span style="font-weight: bold;">will not</span> be applied to calculate 
 Net Risked after Royalty. Risk and Shrinkage will be applied first.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Royalties</span> 
 will be applied to the Net Risked Shrunk value for a given reporting period. 
 As Royalties are configured as a time series, the appropriate Royalty 
 Rate for each of the reporting periods will be applied in the form of 
 Net Risked Sales Production x (1 - Royalty Rate).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Production_Types"></a>Production Types</h3>
        <p>Production segments can also contain 'Actuals' (Field Estimates, Actuals 
 and Financial Actuals) data. esi.manage treats the values preferentially:</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Financial Actuals</span> are presumed 
 to be the most accurate, followed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Actuals</span> 
 and then <span style="font-weight: bold;">Field Estimates</span>.</p>
        <p>As indicated above, from a calculation perspective Actuals have <span style="font-weight: bold;">no Risk</span> (POS = 100%) and they are <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrunk</span> (Shrinkage = 0).</p>
        <p>As an example, consider a variance Report where the Production Type 
 is Actuals. If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Risked Sales</span> 
 Production Definition is compared to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unrisked 
 Raw</span>, the variance will be 0.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Each Production Type can be used explicitly for calculations; i.e., 
 Report on Production Actuals. In this scenario, the only factor that will 
 affect the results will be the intersection/overlap between the Data Dates 
 (the periods for each Actuals record) and the Reporting Dates (the Start 
 and End dates for each calculation period).</p>
        <p>The precedence of Production Data Types is used in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Blended</span> 
 calculations. For a given period, Financial Actuals will be used (if present) 
 first, followed by Actuals, Field Estimates and then Forecast values.

 Period versus Data Period</h3>
        <p>For the following section, the Calculation Period is represented by

 based on May 1, 2011 (Start Date) and May 31, 2011 (End Date).</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">For Formulaic

        <h3><a name="Blended_Production"></a>Blended Production 
 Calculations</h3>
        <p>&#160;There 
 are two methods of Blended Production calculations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data 
 Driven</span> - this approach will use whatever Data Types exist within 
 a Calculation Period, in order of Preference.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date 
 Driven</span> - this requires Dates (i.e., the Last Actuals Date) to be 
 specified for each Data Type. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Blended Production (as shown in the Production Types figure above) considers 
 Actuals and Field Estimates. </p>
        <p>First, we will describe the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Driven</span> 
 approach. This will require the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Last 
 Actuals</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Last Field Estimates</span> 
 dates to be identified (either user supplied or initialized from the data 
 within the Budget). </p>
        <p>When calculations are being performed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Only data of 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Type Actuals</span> will be used for 
 calculation periods <span style="font-weight: bold;">up to</span> the 
 Last Actuals Date.</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">If, for a 
 particular Production segment, there are no Actuals, but there are Field 
 Estimates within this period, the reported value will be 0.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="NumberedList">Only data of 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Type Field Estimates</span> will be considered 
 for calculation periods <span style="font-weight: bold;">between</span> 
 the Last Actuals and Last Field Estimates Dates.</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">Similarly, 
 if there are Actuals within this Period, they will not be considered.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="NumberedList">Only <span style="font-weight: bold;">Forecast</span> 
 data will be used <span style="font-weight: bold;">after</span> the Last 
 Field Estimates date, regardless of whether there is Actuals or Field 
 Estimates Data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition, the same 'Dates' mechanism described in the Calculation 
 Period section is used when there is an intersection between Calculation 
 periods and Data Type periods.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The specified 
 Last Field Estimates Date was <span style="font-weight: bold;">April 30</span>.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">A particular 
 production segment has a Field Estimates entry that covered <span style="font-weight: bold;">April 
 28</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">May 5</span>, with an average 
 daily production of <span style="font-weight: bold;">100</span>.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">This Field Estimates 
 entry would contribute <span style="font-weight: bold;">300</span> to 
 the April total, and nothing to May.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With Data Driven Blending, the Data Types are 'lined' up in order of 
 preference (Actuals then Field Estimates then Forecast), and the contributions 
 determined based on the intersection / overlap between Calculation Periods 
 and Data Periods.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3><a name="Derived_Products_Calculations"></a>Derived 
 Products Calculations</h3>
        <p>A Product (typically NGLs, Condensate, or Water) can be defined in terms 
 of a Primary Product. The Derived Product segment requires an Asset to 
 be identified, which enables the correct Primary Product production segment(s) 
 to be referenced for calculations.</p>
        <p>A Derived Product's production profile is defined as a Ratio to the 
 Primary Product:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed 
 Ratio</span> - a single value will be used for all time periods.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable 
 Ratio</span> - a series of ratio's are defined in terms of Offset (days, 
 weeks, months, quarters, years) from the Onstream Date or a specific Calendar Date. The last entry 
 in the table defines the ratio to be used for all time periods beyond 
 that Offset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In certain applications, it will be desirable to define a chain of derivations. 
 For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">In a steam injection 
 application, Steam is the Primary Product.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Oil is 'Derived' 
 from the Steam Production.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Gas is then Derived 
 from the Oil</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Production calculations for the Derived Product are based on the calculated 
 profile for its Primary Product, multiplied by the appropriate factor. 
 If a Variable Ratio has been specified, the corresponding Production period 
 is used to determine the correct factor to apply.</p>
        <p>There are two paths through the Production Calculations depending on 
 how the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary Segment</span> was defined:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrinkage 
 = 0</span> - in this case the Primary Segment's production (IP) has been 
 entered as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrunk</span> value.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">The Derived segment's 
 Production will be the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ratio</span> to 
 the Primary segment's calculated production.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">The Derived segment's 
 Production will be reported for <span style="font-weight: bold;">both</span> 
 a Raw and Sales Production Definition.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrinkage 
 &gt; 0</span> - in this case the Primary Segment's production (IP) has 
 been entered as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Raw</span> value.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">The Derived segment's 
 Production will again be the Ratio to the Primary segment's calculated 
 production.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets">However, what is reported 
 is now <span style="font-weight: bold;">dependent</span> on the selected 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Production Definition </span>and on whether 
 it is a Byproduct or an Associated Product.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">For a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Raw</span> 
 definition - the Primary segment will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unshrunk</span> 
 and the Derived <span style="font-weight: bold;">Byproduct</span> segment's 
 Production will be reported as <span style="font-weight: bold;">0</span>. 
 An example here is NGL derived from Gas. &#160;NGL 
 is in gas phase in the raw gas, and therefore not deemed reportable as 
 a raw product. &#160;To 
 report it AND to report the Raw gas would result in double counting of 
 the NGL molecules.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">For a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Raw 
 </span>definition - the Primary segment will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unshrunk</span> 
 and the Derived <span style="font-weight: bold;">Associated</span> segment's 
 Production will be reported as <span style="font-weight: bold;">0</span>. 
 An example here is water associated with oil. &#160;Water 
 is present and measurable in the raw fluid stream, and therefore deemed 
 reportable as a raw product.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">For a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales</span> 
 definition - the Primary segment will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrunk</span> 
 (based on the Shrinkage%), and the Derived <span style="font-weight: bold;">Byproduct 
 </span>segment's Production <span style="font-weight: bold;">will be</span> 
 reported based on the defined Ratio. Using the NGL derived from Gas example, 
 the NGL has now been separated and liquefied (and more importantly the 
 gas volume has been reduced to allow for this extraction). It will be 
 reported based on the defined Ratio.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">For a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales</span> 
 definition - the Primary segment will be Shrunk (based on the Shrinkage%), 
 and the Derived <span style="font-weight: bold;">Associated</span> Product 
 segment's Production will be reported based on the defined Ratio. This 
 is no different than in the Raw case above.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
