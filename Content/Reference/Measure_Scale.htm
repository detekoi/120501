            <MadCap:keyword term="Measure Scale" />Measure Scale</h1>
        <p>Measure Scale is used to scale measures when running Analysis Cases, Expenditure Analysis, Opex Analysis or Production Analysis.</p>
        <p>The nature of the <MadCap:keyword term="scaling" />scaling can be anything that should be modelled that is not in the predefined options of esi.manage.</p>
        <p>The Measure Scale works by selecting a hierarchy type from the drop down menu, and then one or more specific values of that hierarchy type on which selected measure or measures (Expenditures, Opex, Production) will be scaled when using this Scale File in an Analysis.</p>
        <p>Any number of <MadCap:keyword term="Scale Files" />Scale Files can be configured combining Measure Scale Hierarchies values and Measures.</p>
        <p>A new Measure Scale file is created by selecting the <img src="../Images/scaleplus.png" /> button in the Configuration section (Defaults &gt;&gt; Measure Scale). You will be prompted to provide a File name which can be referenced when you want Measure Escalation applied to esi.manage analysis.</p>
        <p>Data is entered by a selected Hierarchy, in a particular escalation file, for a specific measure. Each Measure type will be available for its own escalation rate.</p>
        <p>Opex is available separately by Fix and Variable, and also by Opex type.<br />Expenditures is available by Expenditure Type.<br />Production is available by Product.</p>
        <p>The multiple scales in different levels will be inherited and combined. The result is the effective measure that will be applied when the Scale File will be used in an Analysis.</p>
        <p>To show the Effective Scale, the <img src="../Images/EffectiveScaleButton.png" /> button must be clicked. Otherwise, the numbers shown in the table are the ones we have entered, or the default value ‘1’.</p>
        <p>There is an option to Duplicate an Escalation file, in order to keep much of the data and only modifying a select number of entries.</p>
