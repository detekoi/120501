        <h1>Jurisdictions and Economic Groups</h1>
        <p>Jurisdictions model the burdens on project economics put in place by 
 the regimes governing the regions production is coming from. Jurisdictional 
 economic burdens can be used to model taxes, special participation expenses, 
 government tariffs, and other factors external to the project that effect 
 its financial feasibility.</p>
        <p>Royalties for sliding price scales or triggers can also be configured 
 for the local/regional economic group within a national or global jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Jurisdictions can be defined as a tree in the heirarchy which is then treated as something known as <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Economic groups.</span></p>
        <p>Each project is assigned a Jurisdiction on the Project Details screen when the project is first created.</p>
        <p>There are three separate tabs for each global jurisdiction (settings, 
 Burdens and Taxes)</p>
        <p>There are three separate tabs for each local / regional economic group 
 (Royalties, Burdens and Taxes)</p>
        <p>For any Economic Group you have the option to set any of the following: Default Currency, Royalties (percentages, and/or price triggers), Taxes, Burdens, Depreciation, or Custom Economic Calculations.  Please see the relevant sections of the help file for assistance in configuring any of these.</p>
