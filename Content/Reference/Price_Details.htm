        <h1>Price Details</h1>
        <p>The Price Details view is where the Prices, Scales and Offsets are entered.</p>
        <p>You can use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Price Editor</span> 
 to filter the data to one or more Scenarios.</p>
        <p>Price Forecasts which are Top Level Forecasts will only have a Price 
 column. The values that are entered are in terms of the Production Unit 
 and Currency for the particular Forecast.</p>
        <p>Price Forecasts which have a Base Forecast have a Scale and Offset column. 
 The result of the two terms is a y = mx + b relationship. When any cell 
 is selected, the bottom of the table will display the route to the calculation 
 of the Effective Price.</p>
        <p>You don't not have to enter values for all periods - esi.manage will 
 use the last supplied data for all future periods, until another user 
 supplied value is encountered.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Effective Price button will display the Calculated 
 value for every Price Forecast.</p>
        <p>The Details Table can be worked with in an Annual mode, or Monthly.</p>
