        <h2>Import Process</h2>
        <p>Importing data into esi.manage utilizes an import Wizard. Each screens of the wizard has a matching topic in this 
 Help File. The general process is illustrated below:</p>
        <p>Please refer to the specific import types found in this file for the 
 process on individual areas.</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Access the Wizard 
 by selecting File / Import Data.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Select the Import 
 Type (AFE Details, AFE Headers, CAPEX Details, CAPEX Headers, OPEX, Production, 
 External Identifiers, or Project Hierarchy).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Select the Budget 
 the data is to be imported into (note that the Budget selection step is 
 skipped for Hierarchy and EID imports as configuration information applies 
 to your entire esi.manage Database).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Choose the File 
 to be imported, specify whether the First Line is a header, and Validate 
 the selected File (i.e., the correct number of columns, columns have the 
 correct data types).</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">If there 
 are validation errors, the import can be cancelled or 
 can Proceed with Valid Records only.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="NumberedList">Optionally Clear 
 Data. The import file is analyzed for the data types (Field Estimates, 
 Forecast, Actuals, etc.), and the earliest Start Date and Latest End Date.</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">The Clear 
 Data page is initialized to those Types and Dates. The Clear Data function 
 will remove existing records in the database that match the type and fall 
 within the Dates.</li>
                <li class="NumberedList">Optionally 
 select the Matching option, in which case the Clear (using the Types and 
 Dates as described above) is limited to only those Projects found in the 
 Import File (either through the mapped EID, or an identified project).</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="NumberedList">Import the Data 
 into esi.manage.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Press Finish 
 which will generate a log file with the import results (number of records, 
 valid records, errors, etc.), and esi.manage will prompt to be restarted.</li>
        </ol>
