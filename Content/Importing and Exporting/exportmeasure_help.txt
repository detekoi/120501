NAME
  exportMeasure - export measure data

SYNOPSIS
  exportMeasure -p PARAMETERFILE [FILE]
  exportMeasure --params PARAMETERFILE [FILE]
  exportMeasure [OPTIONS] [-x NAME [OPTIONS]]... [-c NAME [OPTIONS]]... STARTDATE INTERVALS PERIODICITY PROJECTSET
  
DESCRIPTION
  exportMeasure computes measure data for the PROJECTSET from the STARTDATE for
  the number of INTERVALS with a PERIODICITY.  Columns are defined with the -c 
  option or the -x option. -x is deprecated and maintained for backwards
  compatibility. Both -x and -c handle the same set of options. The difference
  between -x and -c is that columns defined with -x occur in the ouput BEFORE
  the date, and columns defined with -c occurs AFTER the date. By default 
  exportMeasure outputs to standard output.

  names are:

  NUMBER: 0,1,2,etc...

  PERIODICY: D|M|Q|Y

  defined in esi.manage configuration.

  PROJECTSET: /[Private|Public][/FOLDER]...[/PROJECT_SET]
  
  RESERVE_CONSOLIDATION: [RESERVE_CATEGORY:]NAME must be a supported reserve
  consolidation, to use a global consolidation do not supply a reserve category. The
  available consolidations are defined in esi.manage configuration. The default value is
  "Expected Value"; do not supply a value for this option to use the default.
  
  TRUNCATE_VARIANT: CALCULATED|ECONOMIC
    CALCULATED                            calculated from associated production
    ECONOMIC                              as calculated, except truncated at economic limit date
    
  TIME_SELECTOR: ALL|DATE
    ALL                                   the reserve progression as of date matched the reporting period.
    DATE                                  the reserve progression as of date is DATE (see DATE)

  UNIT: the format of the unit depends on it type.  For currency based measure
  you must supply a valid currency abbreviation as defined in esi.manage 
  configuration.  For production based measure you must provide a valid 
  PRODUCT:VOLUME as defined in esi.manage configuration.

  VERSION: FORECAST|FIELD_ESTIMATE|ACTUAL|FINANCIAL_ACTUAL|BLENDED
