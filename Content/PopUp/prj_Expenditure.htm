        <h3>Expenditure</h3>
        <p>Every Expenditure must be associated against an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Asset</span>. 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">The Expenditure is <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">initialized</span> with 
 the WI% of the Asset</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each Expenditure has a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start</span> 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">End Date</span>, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Amount</span> 
 and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Probability of Doing</span> (PD%).</p>
        <p>Expenditures can be '<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">chained</span>' 
 together:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">The Start Date of an Expenditure 
 must be <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">later than</span> 
 the End Date of the Expenditure it is Dependent On.</li>
            <li class="Bullets">PD% are propagated through 
 the chain, resulting in a cumulative <span style="font-weight: bold;">Net 
 Probability of Doing</span> (NPD%) for each Expenditure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other Measures, as well as the Asset, can be made Dependent on an Expenditure, 
 in which case the <span style="font-weight: bold;">NPD%</span> of that 
 Expenditure is <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">calculated</span> 
 into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Probability of Success</span> 
 (POS%) for the Measure. </p>
