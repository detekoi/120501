        <h3>Analytical Tools</h3>
        <p>Reports, Export Jobs and Analysis Cases can be configured and applied 
 against a set of Projects (via the Project Set) to Analyze how your 'plan' 
 is progressing. </p>
        <p>Project analysis is delivered through the Analysis View, which works 
 against a Project's data, presenting both a Tabular and Graphical format. 
 </p>
        <p>The Analysis View can be configured to follow you - i.e.; as you select 
 a new Project to work with, the Analysis Screen will automatically Update 
 the data display.</p>
