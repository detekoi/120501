        <h3>Ranking Results</h3>
        <p>Once all of the Metrics have been defined, and Ranking Units specified, 
 select the Rank button in the Ranking Results pane. Each of the Projects 
 will be evaluated for each of the Metrics in the Ranking file. The Ranking 
 Results table is a grid of Projects and Metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">Metric</span> 
 is shown as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">column</span> with the 
 calculated value for each Project.</li>
            <li class="Bullets">Each <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project</span> 
 is shown as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">line</span>, with the value 
 for each Metric, and a total <span style="font-weight: bold;">Score</span> 
 based on all Metrics that are to be scored.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To determine the Score:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Each Metric is 
 first evaluated across all projects to determine the Range (if a Ceiling 
 or Floor has been specified for a Metric, values outside of that Range 
 are scored based on either that Range).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The 'Best' metric 
 value is assigned a score of 100, the poorest a score of 0. Weighting 
 is simply a multiplier of the 0-100 score.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Metric values 
 which fall within the range are interpolated. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">For each Project 
 the score for each metric is summed to provide a Total Score.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Ranking Results table can be sorted on any column, as well as having 
 a Colour scheme applied (colour coding on a metric by metric basis)</p>
