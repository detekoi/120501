        <h3>The Navigator</h3>
        <p>Each of the following items represent Features in <span style="font-weight: bold;">esi</span>.manage 
 that can be Configured and Saved.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Set</span> 
 - a collection of Projects, either selected individually, or based on 
 filtering.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report</span> 
 - a pre-defined Report Type (CAPEX, OPEX) which can be configured using 
 a variety of options.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis Case</span> 
 - Discounted Cash Flow calculations, both Before and After Tax.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Export Job</span> 
 - Project Data (user Supplied and Calculated) for a variable time period, 
 using an XML schema.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Folder Structure</span> under each 
 Navigator node can be configured to suit your company's needs. Each node 
 has two default folders, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Private</span> 
 (user specific) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Public</span> (available 
 to everyone with sufficient Permissions).</p>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Set</span> is a fundamental 
 building block. Reports, Analysis Cases and Export Jobs have two aspects:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>The Configuration of their calculations, and </li>
            <li>the Project Set(s) they are to apply the calculations 
 against. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Project Sets can be used to Populate the Project List, and you can also 
 Apply the features listed above against a Project Set.</p>
