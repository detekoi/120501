        <h3>Ranking Metrics</h3>
        <p>Metrics are a way of evaluating the Projects; what can be selected as 
 a Metric are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Measures</span> 
 - Capital, Production</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance 
 Metrics</span> - Exit Rate, F&amp;D, Lifting Cost</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Economic</span> 
 Metrics - NPV, DROI, IRR, etc.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attributes</span> 
 - any Project attribute that has been configured to be Rankable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For most metrics you will need to specify the period that the Metric 
 is to be evaluated over. This duration is comprised of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone</span> 
 - this identifies how the Start Date for the metric should be determined 
 on a Project by Project basis. Some of the options include: Budget Start 
 Date, Custom Milestone, Earliest Project Date, First Onstream Date, etc.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offset</span> 
 - how many Intervals are to be calculated from the selected Milestone 
 for each project.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interval</span> 
 - the periodicity (Days, Months, Years) that is to be used in conjunction 
 with the Milestone and the Offset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most metrics can be calculated as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Risked</span> 
 or <span style="font-weight: bold;">UnRisked</span>. </p>
        <p>For metrics that require Revenue, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Price 
 File</span> can be selected.</p>
        <p>To support the calculation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Score</span> 
 for each Project there is the ability to specify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weight</span> 
 - relative weighting between Metrics.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ceiling</span> 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Floor</span> - a way to control the 
 interval used for calculating the Score - metric values that fall outside 
 of the Ceiling or Floor don't skew the results.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target</span> 
 - specify a Target for the metric (i.e., allowed Capital Spend for the 
 current Budget Year). The Gap between Target and Result is reported in 
 the Summary.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Score</span> 
 - metrics can be calculated and used for Targets, but not contribute to 
 the Score for each Project. For example, Capital is often a Metric with 
 a Target, but may not be scored for each Project.</li>
        </ul>
