        <p>There are two types of Price Forecasts available for creation.</p>
        <p>The first is a top level Price Forecast which is entered as a single 
 price number. &#160;An 
 example of a top level Price forecast would be your base WTI/Brent price 
 for Oil and NYMEX for Gas.</p>
        <p>The second is a nested Price forecast which is entered as a scale and 
 offset against the node above it. &#160;There 
 is no limit as to the number of levels of nesting are used.</p>
