        <h3>Actuals Up To Date</h3>
        <p>Month End is often an iterative process reconciling the different sources 
 of data, i.e.;</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Field Estimates</span> 
 - which represent the Project Manager's view of the progress, particularly 
 for Capital Expenditures</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Actuals</span> 
 - which represents what the Finance department has received in terms of 
 invoices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;For a 
 Project, the delta between Field Estimates to date, and Actuals to date, 
 can be used to generate the Accrual amount for the current Month.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
