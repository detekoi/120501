        <h3>Shift Date Function</h3>
        <p>There are many places in esi.manage that provide the ability to Move 
 the dates of a Project or Asset. All of these tools utilize the same routine:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Earliest 
 Date (Project or Asset, depending on what is being shifted) is first determined 
 from all appropriate Measures (Expenditures, Production, Reserves and 
 OPEX). This date is displayed as the Start Date within the Project Details.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Shift Dates 
 feature allows you to shift by a Number of Days, or select a new Earliest 
 Start Date.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">If Earliest State 
 is supplied, it will be used with the existing Start Date from 1 to determine 
 a corresponding Number of Days.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">This value is 
 applied to all Forecast Data dates within the Project (or Asset).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note that:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Actuals data 
 is not changed.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Any entry whose 
 'Started' flag is set to True (Expenditures, Onstream) will not be shifted.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
