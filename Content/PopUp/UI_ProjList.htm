        <h3>The Project List</h3>
        <p>The Project List <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> be 
 the set of Projects that you wish to Edit, or whose data you need to look 
 at in detail. Reports, Analysis Cases and Export Jobs do not require a 
 Project to be in the Project List to be part of the calculations.</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>The Project List can be based on making a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Set(s)</span> the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Active 
 Selection</span>, using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Browser 
 Filters</span> (if it is the Active Selection), or both.</li>
            <li>Projects can be opened from the Project List by 
 double clicking on it. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project View</span> 
 will open in the pane at the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li>Tools and Tasks (accessed from the Button Ribbon) 
 can be applied against the Project List, or a selected Project. </li>
        </ol>
