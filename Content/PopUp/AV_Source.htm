        <h3>Source Data</h3>
        <p>For each of the Analysis Views, there are several selections that will 
 filter the Source Data. There is no interaction between the 'Source Lists', 
 i.e.; the selections in one list do not re-filter the other lists.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expenditure</span> 
 - for the Expenditure Analysis View, this is the aggregate list of Expenditures 
 from the Project scope.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Asset</span> 
 - for the OPEX and Production Analysis view, this is the aggregate list 
 of Assets from the Project scope.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Type</span> 
 - the entire list of Expenditure or OPEX Types, from the esi.manage Configuration. 
 </li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AFEs</span>, 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Products</span> - for Expenditure and 
 Production analysis views.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If no filtering is selected, the display will be the aggregate of the 
 Projects in the Projects List.</p>
