        <h3>Monthly Accruals</h3>
        <p>The first pass through the Month End process (particularly for Capital 
 Expenditures) involves:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Ensuring that the Field Estimates, represent the 
 best estimate of the work done (in terms of dollar amounts) in the current 
 month. </li>
            <li>Entering whatever Actuals have been received in 
 the current month. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Part of the current month's Actuals will potentially represent work 
 that was accrued in previous months - so the determination of how much 
 to accrue in the current month will/may be the delta between Field Estimates 
 (for the period of the particular Expenditure) less the Actuals over the 
 same period.</p>
        <p>A similar process can be applied for OPEX and Production, particularly 
 for non-operated assets.</p>
        <p>Once the accrual amounts have been determined, new Import Files can 
 be generated and imported.</p>
