        <h3>Grouping in Reports</h3>
        <p>All Reports have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Grouping parameter</span>; 
 the options that are available are a combination of Hierarchy Elements 
 and choices appropriate to the Report Type. Five Levels of Grouping can 
 be applied.</p>
        <p>The specified &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Grouping(s)</span> 
 are used in conjunction with the selected <span style="font-weight: bold;">Projects 
 </span>in a nested manner. The lowest Sub Group level is generally where 
 the 'line item' Data from the Projects is reported. Sub-Totals are written 
 out at each Grouping level.</p>
        <p>Grouping can be utilized with the Suppress Details option, in which 
 case only the Total lines at every Grouping level are reported. </p>
