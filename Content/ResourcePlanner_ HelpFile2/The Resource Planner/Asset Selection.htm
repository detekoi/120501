            <br />The asset selection screen appears in the top left hand part of the Resource Planning perspective. The Asset Selection view allows the user to select which assets and activities (expenditures) to be represented in the Schedule / Gantt Chart. Assets to be considered are selected by pre-defined Project Set or by Budget. Note: Project Sets with filters on hierarchy or attribute types not supported by Resource Planner and will not appear in the list. </p>
