        <h2>Project Sets</h2>
        <p class="NumberedList_1">Project sets are a key part of the asset selection process. Before starting to use Resource Planner, verify that assets within projects are grouped into appropriate project sets such as by resource line or rig line&#160; (i.e. a group of rigs or other resources for which the user would like to simultaneously schedule activities).</p>
