        <h2 class="Heading2">Resource Selection View</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2"><span class="span_2">The Resource selection view is found in the bottom left hand corner of the Resource Planning perspective. </span><span class="span_2">The resource selection view has ‘Select all’ and ‘Clear all’ buttons to make it quick and simple to select a large number of resources simultaneously. There are also two drop down buttons, one relating to the Capacity File and the other relating to the Category of the Capacity File. This allows the user to navigate quickly to the correct Capacity File if there is a long list of Capacity Files to choose from.</span>

            <br /><span class="span_2">Once the Capacity File and Category has been selected, the list of resources within the Capacity file will be displayed with a checkbox besides them. As you click on each check box, a new Resource Line will appear in the Resource Line view ready for the assets and activities defined within the Asset Selection view to be scheduled against.</span>

        <h3 class="Heading3">Resource Selection</h3>
        <p class="p_5">Resource Selection is a two-step process, first we must select our Capacity File, and this will be set up in the Configuration Perspective, this will contain our Resources. The second step within the process is the use of the second drop down menu, and this will contain our Categories. Categories will further define our Resource Selection, these will define which type of resource we will need to use, ie human vs equipment. </p>
