        <p class="p_5">The drag and drop functionality provides a very easy way to adjust the schedule and automatically updates the start and end date of the activity and production. It does this by invoking the asset date shift functionality when the user moves the bars. This way, when moving the bars around it is moving not just that expenditure, but all of the expenditures, production, resources and Opex associated with that asset. The shift is “anchored” to a single activity. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="p_5">The Drag and Drop settings icon allows the User to select between to options: <span class="span_3">Drop Side by Side on Same Resource</span>, and <span class="span_3">Insert into timeline shifting assets to make space</span>. Side by side is the default behavior,&#160; when the User drops an activity onto the Gantt chart, the activity lands below the mouse, creating an over allocation if necessary.&#160; </p>
        <p class="p_5">The new mode is “<span class="span_3">Insert into timeline shifting assets to make space</span>”.&#160; When the user drops your allocation it will move itself to immediately after the intersected allocation. This “insert” function will insert the activity into the resource line and insert “padding” or a selected amount of gap days on either side of the inserted activity. The rest of the schedule for that entire line is shifted to make the next allocation start immediately after the allocation that was just dropped plus your padding.</p>
