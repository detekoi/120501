        <h2>Limitations between single and multi-expenditure selection</h2>
        <p class="p_5">When selecting expenditures the user may choose to allocate against many or to allocate just against one expenditure. There are certain limitations which will be activated when selecting one or the other, for single expenditure selection this will allow the use of the Auto-Build function within the Schedule Builder. When choosing multiple expenditure this will allow for the viewing of the relationships between different activity types but the Auto-Build function will be disabled. </p>
