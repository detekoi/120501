        <h2>Scheduling Order</h2>
        <p class="p_5">Once the user has defined the start date for the schedule, the next step is to sort the assets and activities based on scheduling requirements. Any of the visible Schedule Builder columns can be used to sort the data, simply by clicking the header of the desired column (clicking the column header more than once toggles between sorting by ascending and descending orders.) Or users can utilize the default Schedule attribute column, ‘Scheduling Priority’, to enter specific priorities then sort by that column. The schedule order will be determined by the order that the projects are listed in within the Schedule Builder. </p>
