        <h2>Schedule Builder</h2>
        <p class="p_9">In the default layout, the Schedule Builder is found in the bottom right hand area of the Resource Planning perspective. The Schedule builder is a table of rows and columns. The rows represent each combination of project asset and activity / Expense to be scheduled across the different resources. There are also a series of default columns containing different criteria about each activity. These columns can be sorted so that the assets / activities at the top of the list will be scheduled first. This makes it very quick and simple to produce an order for the schedule.</p>
