            <br />Users can change the order, add, and remove columns by using the ‘Change Viewable Columns’ feature. This function is associated with one of the powerful features of Resource Planner, which is modifying (multiple) Schedule and Asset Attributes (Project Attributes are read-only) across projects in tabular fashion. This means users can copy the visible tabular data from Schedule Builder to an external tool such as Microsoft Excel, collaborate with others outside of <span class="span_1">esi</span>.manage<sup>TM</sup> then paste the modified data back in Resource Planner’s Schedule Builder to save the schedule permanently in <span class="span_1">esi</span>.manage<sup>TM</sup>. </p>
