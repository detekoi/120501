        <h1>Variance Options</h1>
        <p>The Variance Options Tab allows the user to further define the granularity of the variance report that should be displayed. There are three main options that a user can choose from.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/varianceoptions.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The three options are as shown above, Exclude Projects if they are not selected in the other budget, Exclude projects if they are also selected in the other budget and Include unselected projects if they are selected in the other budget.</p>
        <p>The first of the three option is used to remove projects from selection within chosen budget if the projects are not contained in the second budget being variance against. This will be used to compare projects that are the same in both Budgets.</p>
        <p>The Second option is used to remove projects from selection within chosen budgets if the projects are contained within the second budget being variance against. This will be used to compare projects that are not within the both budgets.</p>
        <p>The third and final option is used to bring projects that are filtered out within our selected budget back into selection if and only if they are selected within the second budget being compared against. This will be used to compare projects that have been filtered out from the selected budget to the same projects within the second/comparison budget.</p>
