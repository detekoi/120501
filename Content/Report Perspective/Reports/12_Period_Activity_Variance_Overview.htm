        <h1>Activity Variance 
 Report Overview</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This report shows the variance between what was expected to happen in 
 Budget 1 and what actually happened in Budget 2, based on Expenditures. 
 It breaks out the Capital Expenditures of each project and aggregates 
 them by CAPEX type. Then takes the start/end date of each expenditure 
 and allots the capital amount over the appropriate time period. Each entry 
 has 3 lines:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Line</span> is the value for 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span> budget you selected</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Line</span> is the value for 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span> budget you selected</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Line</span> 
 (with gray shading) is the <span style="font-style: italic;">variance</span> 
 between the two.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There is also a total of all the periods combined, and an average. The 
 report includes a grand total that rolls up all the values for each period 
 at the bottom of the report.</p>
