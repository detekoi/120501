        <h1>OPEX Detail Report Overview</h1>
        <p>This report shows a breakdown of all Operating Expenses for a selected 
 budget or group of Projects. It drills down into detail right down to 
 the individual OPEX Type. Individual line items belonging to the same 
 Type are rolled up into a single aggregate line for each Asset.</p>
        <p>This report provides values at the Project, Asset, and Type levels. 
 It gives you a value for each period, as well as an Average over the periods 
 selected and a Total all the periods combined. A Grand Total of each field 
 is also available at the bottom of the report.</p>
