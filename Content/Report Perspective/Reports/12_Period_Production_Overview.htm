        <h1>Production Report Overview</h1>
        <p>This report shows your production by Asset and Product over the selected 
 time periods.</p>
        <p>The report gives you the Production numbers over the selected periods 
 for each product you defined, the Onstream date of that product for each 
 Asset, the UWI, the Asset name and the Project &#160;Name.</p>
        <p>There is also a total of all the periods combined, and an average. The 
 report includes a grand total that rolls up all the values for each period 
 at the bottom of the report.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note on this Report:</span>
        </p>
        <p>Using the Daily Rate toggle</p>
        <p>Some users may wish to see the daily production rate, but over a monthly 
 time period. To do this - keep your time period set at "Monthly" 
 and under "Toggles", set "Daily Rate" to on. This 
 will provide you with a report showing the <span style="font-style: italic;">average</span> <span>daily production rate for each month, over the 12-month period defined. 
 The difference between selecting "Daily" as your time period, 
 is if you do that you will only see 12 days worth of production, with 
 the production values day-by-day.</span></p>
