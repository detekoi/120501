        <h1>Operations Performance Report Overview</h1>
        <p>The Operations Performance report compares production and operational expenditures from the original forecast amount to the actual amount(s) for the current month, prior month, and year to date time periods.</p>
        <p>It provides the user with a benchmark of where they are in regards to the production they are receiving versus how much they are spending to get the product out of the ground. It also helps identify projects that may have production shortfalls, cost overruns, or lower-than-average rate-of-return on the operational expense going into them.</p>
