        <h1>OPEX Detail Variance Report Overview</h1>
        <p>This report shows a breakdown of all Operating Expenses for Projects 
 in one budget and compares them to another budget . It drills down into 
 detail right down to the individual OPEX Type. Individual line items belonging 
 to the same Type are rolled up into a single aggregate line for each Asset. 
 Each item is broken out into three lines:</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Line</span> is the value for 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span> budget you selected</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Line</span> is the value for 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span> budget you selected</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Line</span> <span>(with gray shading) is the</span><span style="font-style: italic;">variance</span> <span>between the two.</span></p>
        <p>You can also select the same source budget but change the Production 
 Definition or Production Type to see the difference between Risked and 
 Unrisked, or Forecast and Actual numbers.</p>
        <p>This report provides values at the Project, Asset, and Type levels. 
 It gives you a value for each period, as well as an Average over the periods 
 selected and a Total all the periods combined. A Grand Total of each field 
 is also available at the bottom of the report.</p>
