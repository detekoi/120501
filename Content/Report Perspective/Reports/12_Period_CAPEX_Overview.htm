        <h1>CAPEX Report Overview</h1>
        <p>The CAPEX report shows the breakdown of Capital Expenditures over a 
 selected time period. The report shows each Project in the selected budget, 
 broken down into the respective Assets, and further divided to show the 
 individual Expenditure lines for that asset.</p>
        <p>The totals show a sum of the Expenditures at the Asset and Project roll-up 
 levels.</p>
        <p>You can customize this report to show different Capital Definitions 
 (Risked, Unrisked, Gross, Net, etc.), different Capital Types (Forecast, 
 Field Estimate, Actuals...). You can only show one combination at a time 
 on this report however, if you want to see a comparison between two, you 
 will need to run the Capital Expenditure Variance report.</p>
