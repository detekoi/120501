        <h1>Product Production Report Overview</h1>
        <p>This report shows your production by Asset and Product over the selected 
 time periods. This report is unique in that it does not force you to select 
 an equivalency to report multiple products - you can select up to 3 products 
 and have the numbers reflect different units for each.</p>
        <p>The report gives you the Production numbers over the selected periods 
 for each product you defined, the Onstream date of that product for each 
 Asset, the UWI, the Asset name and the Project &#160;Name.</p>
        <p>There is also a total of all the periods combined, and an average. The 
 report includes a grand total that rolls up all the values for each period 
 at the bottom of the report.</p>
