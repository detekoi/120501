        <h2>Synchronization</h2>
        <p>All Measures within a Project must be associated against an Asset. There 
 is the option with Variable OPEX entries to choose the All Assets option; 
 however, since Variable OPEX Amounts are based on Production, they will 
 inherit the WI% and POS% from the corresponding Production Segments.</p>
        <p>There are two key data elements that are found with each Measure; the 
 WI% and POS%. The presumption is that, for a given Asset, these values 
 will be consistent for every Measure entry that is associated with the 
 Asset.</p>
        <p>When a new entry is created, Production for example, once the Asset 
 has been selected the WI% and POS% will be initialized from the corresponding 
 values for the Asset. If a change is made to a WI% or POS% for a particular 
 entry, all other Measures that are associated with that Asset will be 
 examined, and if a difference is found, the Synchronization Dialogue is 
 presented.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> that it is not required that the POS% and WI% are consistent across 
 all measures.</p>
