        <h2>Production Baseline Configuration</h2>
        <p>If Production Baseline 
 has been enabled, an additional Data element is added to the Production 
 table. &#160;</p>

            <li class="Bullets">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Baseline</span> 
 element is a Boolean and indicates the Production Segment that will represent 
 the Base (existing) production profile </li>

        </p>
        <p>Only one Production segment can be identified per Asset/ Production 
 SubCategory / Zone combination.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Uplift Segments</h3>
        <p>An uplift segment is configured as any other Production segment. However, 
 the interpretation of some elements has particular significance when modelling 
 Baseline.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Baseline 
 Flag</span> is False - which indicates that this is an Uplift segment 
 (you will not be allowed to tag more than one Asset/Product combination 
 as the Baseline segment).</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IP</span> 
 - the Initial Production Rate.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">If Total Uplift, this 
 IP <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> include the Base production. 
 For accurate modelling, this value should be the sum of the Base Production 
 Daily Rate (at the anticipated Uplift Onstream Date), plus whatever incremental 
 production is anticipated from the activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OnStream 
 Date</span> - indicates when the Uplift is Forecast to come Onstream. 
 No Production will be reported prior to the earliest Onstream Date for 
 the Uplift Segments.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OffStream 
 Date / Rate</span> - the implication of these values is dependant on which 
 type of Uplift (Total or Incremental) is being used.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">As Total Uplift includes 
 the Base, there will be NO production reported after the Onstream Date/Rate 
 for the Uplift Segment.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="NumberedList">Multiple Uplift 
 segments can be created against the same Asset/Product.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gaps</span> 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overlaps</span> are allowed between 
 segments. If there is an overlap in the Dates (the Offstream Date for 
 the first Uplift segment is later than the Onstream Date of the second 
 Uplift segment), the Uplift contributions are additive.</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">If Total 
 Uplift is being used, and both Uplift Segments include the Base in their 
 IP's, the Reported Uplift production will likely be larger by the Base 
 contribution during the overlap period. For example: Baseline = 100, Uplift 
 1 = 120, Uplift 2 = 130. With no overlap in dates between Uplift Segment 
 1 and 2, the reported Uplift amount will be 20 and then 30. If there is 
 an overlap, the reported Uplift will be 150 during the overlap period. 
 This <span style="font-weight: bold;">may not</span> be the anticipated 
 result.</li>
