        <h2><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Backout</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Backout is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Site-Specific' Feature</span>, 
 and as such, has been developed under a <span style="font-weight: bold;">specific 
 set</span> of assumptions. The corresponding Backout calculations are 
 appropriate <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> for those specific 
 set of assumptions. Unless this feature is enabled in the Configuration, 
 none of the screens shown below will be visible in a Project.</p>
        <p>The Backout screen under the Production editor allows you to calculate 
 the actual benefit of bringing a new well online into an existing system 
 that will cause other assets in a connected system to have to decrease 
 their output.</p>
        <p>The Backout screen can be accessed from the "Backout" tab 
 in the Production editor or by clicking the Backout barrel icon in the 
 toolbar.</p>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Select an Asset that is affected, and which product 
 is effected.</li>
            <li>Set the start date of the Backout period by setting 
 an Offset Period and Offset Amount.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none;">
                <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
                    <li>Example of Offset: An asset with production 
 coming onstream January 1 with an Offset Amount of 6 and an Offset Period 
 of Months would see the Backout period start July 1.</li>
                    <li>If the Offset Amount was 10 and the Offset 
 Period days, it would start January 11.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Enter the duration of the Backout by setting a 
 duration and selecting a period. Based on a combination of Offset and 
 Duration, Start and End dates will auto-populate.</li>
            <li>The Backout factor is the amount of production 
 lost as a result of the Backout. This needs to be entered *in the same 
 unit* as the selected production was entered for the selected asset.</li>

        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>esi</b></span>.manage<span style="font-size: 8pt;vertical-align: Super;">TM</span>, the opportunity 
 cost of the new well is attributed to the well <span style="font-style: italic;">causing</span> 
 the backout, <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> against the 
 wells actually operating at reduced capacity. See disclaimer at the bottom 
 of the Backout page show above.</p>
