        <p>Within the dependencies tab, there are several calculations provided 
 within the data view. &#160;Calculations 
 will behave different based on dependencies that have specified. &#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NPD%</span> = Net Probability of Doing 
 %</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NPS%</span> = Net Probability of Success 
 %</p>
        <p>*the two values above are calculated automatically based on the values 
 entered in the following 4 fields:</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity Factor (AF%)</span> – Based 
 on the value entered here, the NPD% and NPS% will rise and fall. &#160;</p>
        <p>For example, in the image below, you can see that the AF% is 75% for 
 the Completion expenditure, therefore the highest that NPD% and NPS% can 
 be for that measure (and all subsequent measures in the dependency chain) 
 is 75%.</p>
        <p>&#160;<img src="../Images/27 AF calculation.png" style="border: none;float: none;width: 1161px;height: 99px;" width="1161" height="99" border="0" /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outcome Probability (OP%)</span> – 
 Based on the value entered here, the NPD% and NPS% will rise and fall. 
 &#160;</p>
        <p>For example, in the image below, you can see that the OP% is 50% for 
 the Equip &amp; Tie-in expenditure, therefore the NPD% and NPS% are again 
 effected. &#160;Where 
 previously in the image above these values were reduced to 75% because 
 of the AF% impact, they are now further lowered to 37.5% (A result of 
 the initial NPD% for this expenditure being 75% and subsequently multiplied 
 by the 50% OP value for that line item).</p>
        <p>&#160;<img src="../Images/28 OP calculation.png" style="border: none;width: 1161px;height: 99px;float: none;" width="1161" height="99" border="0" /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Failure (Checkbox)</span> – If this 
 value is checked, the correlated expenditure will only occur when its 
 parent node in the dependency chain fails. Thus, any AF% of OP% values 
 entered for this activity will only effect calculations if the parent 
 entity fails. &#160;</p>
        <p>For Example, the ‘Failure’ value has been specified against the two 
 previously affected measures for the two images above. &#160;Note 
 that the NPD% and NPS% values for those measures are now blanked, as well 
 as any subsequent measures.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/29 failure calculation.png" style="border: none;width: 1281px;height: 102px;float: none;" width="1281" height="102" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reset NPD% (Checkbox)</span> – If this 
 value is checked, the NPD% for that dependency chain is reset to 100% 
 at that measure level. &#160;Previously 
 entered values for AF%/OP% will not affect NPD% or NPS%. &#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;<img src="../Images/30 resetNPD calculation.png" style="border: none;width: 1281px;height: 102px;float: none;" width="1281" height="102" border="0" /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compounded Calculations</span> – As 
 different values are populated for AF% &amp; OP% on a line by line basis, 
 their impact will be compounded to determine the result of NPD% &amp; 
 NPS%. &#160;</p>
        <p>In the example below, you’ll see different AF%/OP% values applied to 
 3 different expenditures. &#160;</p>
        <p>Completion AF% = 75%</p>
        <p>Equip &amp; Tie-in (Well A 0001) OP% = 50%</p>
        <p>Equip &amp; Tie-in (Well A 0002) AF% = 50% &#160;</p>
        <p>Total NPD% &amp; NPS% = 18.75% </p>
        <p>{100% * 75% * 50% * 50% = 18.75%}</p>
        <p>&#160;<img src="../Images/31 compound calc.png" style="border: none;width: 1244px;height: 102px;float: none;" width="1244" height="102" border="0" /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>These compounded calculations provide the accurate overall impact on 
 NPD%&amp; NPS% based on the line-by-line variances of AF% &amp; OP%. </p>
