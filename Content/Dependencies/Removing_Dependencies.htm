        <h2>Removing Dependencies</h2>
        <p>There are multiple ways to remove dependencies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select your measure and click the ‘Unlink’ button <img src="../Images/18 unlink button.png" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;" border="0" /> . 
 &#160;This will 
 unlink the measure from the associated parent(s). &#160;The 
 effected measure will be moved to the top of the measures list where it 
 will appear with no correlation to any other measures.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, a measure can also be deleted <img src="../Images/19 delete button.png" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;" border="0" /> directly 
 from the ‘Dependencies’ tab, which will remove it from the linkage, and 
 will also remove itself and all dependent measures.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note: </b>deleting a measure in the Dependencies tab, will result in 
 that entity being removed from the measures corresponding tab as well, 
 and from the Project entirely.</p>
