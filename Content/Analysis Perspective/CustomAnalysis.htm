        <h1>Custom Analysis </h1>
        <p>The Custom Analysis tab is a combination of the Cashflow and the Metrics tabs, the user can request a set of economics to be calculated and stored as one-line per project. The user is allowed to define what measured and metrics they want to see in that table, with the proviso that everything is expressed at a scalar value, thereby allowing one line per project. Metrics are scalars by definition, and measures are expressed as totals. Project Hierarchy and custom attribute values can be included also. More than one Analysis Case can be stored to allow a data set where scenarios can be compared.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/Analysis_Custom_Tab_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The Custom Tab has four buttons on the top right of the tab, these are as follows: Save Results, Layouts, Nominal/Real, Show/Hide Zeros, and Export.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Save Results</h3>
        <p>All results of the current Analysis Case run (details from all tabs) can be saved, and the results can be re-opened for viewing and exporting later.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Layouts</h3>
        <p>The first of these is the Layouts button, this will be what defines what is within this view (ie Cashflows, Metrics, or a Custom Layout). With this layout button the user will be able to create a Custom Layout, this will allow the user to select a list of parameters that they wish to have their analysis case show.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>To create a Layout:</h4>

        <p>•	This will populate the box below</p>

            <img src="2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>•	Press the Add new Layout button      , this will ask you for a name and what you would like your analysis case to filter by.</p>
        <p>•	To add lines into your analysis case move parameters over from the left (available) column to the right (selected) column. The order in which you select your parameters will determine how they are displayed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Real vs Nominal</h3>
        <p>This button will allow you to select between Real and Nominal economics. Real economics values are relative values compared to commodities or other goods, this means that real values will be adjusted for inflation. Nominal values are the values before inflation and values changes occur. To change the values please click the button and then select which you would like to see your analysis case in.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Show / Hide Zeros</h3>
        <p>There is an option in the top right corner of the Analysis window, called "Hide Zeros". This will hide rows that are all zeros in the Analysis Case. This can lead to different numbers of rows in different roll up levels.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Export</h3>
        <p>Data can be extracted from Analysis Results in several ways. Data can now directly copied out of the Custom table, by selecting and copying cells to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into a spreadsheet. The Custom page can be directly exported to a .csv format by selecting the “Export to csv” button   at the top right of the window. The entire result of the Analysis Case can also be exported directly to Excel, Perspectives and esi.portfolio. For more details, refer to <a href="Analysis Export to Excel.htm">Analysis Export Options</a>.</p>
