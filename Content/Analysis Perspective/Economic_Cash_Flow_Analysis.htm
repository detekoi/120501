 Case, click the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Analyze the Analysis

        <h3>Cash Flow table Navigation</h3>
        <p>As there are a variety of approaches to <a href="Analyse_Individual_Project.htm" target="_popup">running Analysis Cases</a>, 
 there can be a significant degree of nesting in the table. While you can 
 successively navigate through nodes (selecting the Expand option) there 
 are convenient features to streamline this.</p>
        <p>If you right click on a row in the table, the context menu will be displayed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/cash_flow_drill_before.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>By adding or removing focus you can be more specific with what projects 
 or options you would like to see.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/cash_flow_drill_after.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Applying Focus</h3>
        <p>Since there is often a large amount of data in an Analysis Case, it is not possible to visualize all the data at once in the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Analysis_Chart.htm" target="_popup">Analysis Charts</a></span>.
It is possible to "Add Focus" to certain information in the Cashflow table, so that the Analysis Chart only reflects the data of interest.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Expand the Cashflow table to the data to be used in the Analysis Chart.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Right-click on the node that contains the data to be displayed in the Analysis Chart and select "Add Focus". Focus is indicated by a magnifying glass next to the node. <img src="../Images/Focusnode.png" /> Focus can be added to multiple nodes, independently, and all will be displayed in the Analysis.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Switch to the Analysis Chart and configure to display the data as needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Nominal and Real Values</h3>
        <p>The cashflow view supports both nominal and real values. To toggle between the two, select the desired option or simply click the toggle button in the toolbar. </p>
        <p>Real values are based on the uninflated currency at the Real Base Date defined in the Analysis Case: </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/Analysis_Case_Real_View.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Nominal values are based on currency with inflation applied (see <a href="../Currency Inflation.htm">Currency Inflation</a> for details on setting up currency inflation schedule).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/Analysis_Case_Nominal_View.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Cash Flow Column Headings</h3>
        <p>The column headings presented in the Analysis Cashflow can be customized.Click the 'Change Columns' icon to be presented with a set of available and chosen columns. The same functionality can be found in the right-click context menu.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/Analysis - Cash Flow Columns.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You will be presented with the Change Columns dialogue window upon clicking the icon above. Here you can add/remove columns from/to your display. To add a column, highlight it under the Available section, and press the <b>right arrow</b> button to move it to the Selected section.</p>
        <p>The <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> buttons allow the you to re-order columns to suit your preference.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/Analysis - Cash Flow Change Columns.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Select column descriptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Effective Price = Revenue / Total Production</li>
            <li>Net Margin = Revenue - OPEX - Current Tax</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Extracting Data from Analysis Results</h3>
        <p>Data can be extracted from Analysis Results in several ways. Data can now directly copied out of the Cashflow and Income tables, by selecting and copying cells to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into a spreadsheet.  The Cashflow page can be directly exported to a .csv format by selecting the “Export to csv” button <img src="../Images/exportbutton.png" /> at the top right of the window. The entire result of the Analysis Case can also be exported directly to Excel. See the separate section on <a href="Analysis Export to Excel.htm">Analysis Export Options</a> for more information.</p>
