        </p>
        <p>The default “out of the box” truncation is based solely on Operating Income.  The economic limit is calculated by finding the maximum cumulative value of the result of the formula.</p>
        <p>Items can be added to the formula by pressing the plus icon, or items can be subtracted in the formula by pressing the subtraction icon.</p>
        <p>Some items, such as Capital Costs and Operating Costs, allow for additional configuration.  Cost types can be selected from a dropdown menu, allowing the included costs to be customized.</p>
        <p>Unless a custom economic limit calculation is required, 3esi recommends running the default (Operating Income) method.</p>
