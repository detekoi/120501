        <p>Expenditure Depreciation can also be applied to the entire Enterprise 
 by default.</p>
        <p>Each Expenditure Type is grouped so that depreciation can be applied 
 in the same way to all expenditure types in the group. This saves time 
 as you don't need to configure a depreciation method for each expenditure 
 type.</p>
        <p>

        <p>As with the other tabs in the fiscal Model page, the first step is to 
 select the Jurisdiction and / or an Economic Group in the 'Fiscal Model 
 Hierarchy'. Then select the Tax family and the Expenditure group. </p>
        <p>Each Expenditure group is represented as two 'types': <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tangible</span> 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Intangible</span>. These two parts 
 are configured independently for each Expenditure group, however they 
 are connected in that the Total Tangible % + Total Intangible % will always 
 equal 100.</p>
        <p>For each Expenditure/Jurisdiction, the values that can be entered are 
 :</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../Budget-Project/Expenditure_Groups.htm">Group</a></span> - Used to Depreciate 
 a Group of Expenditure Types. &#160;If 
 left blank, the Depreciation will be used as a default for all Expenditure 
 Types, unless otherwise specified in the Depreciation Schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Bullets">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Bullets">Tangible and Intangible Types both have the following 
 selections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Type</span> 
 - Depreciation models (Declining Balance, Straight Line, Sum of Years). 
 These models determine the amount of the original capital cost that is 
 eligible for deduction from the Net Income at the point in time as defined 
 by the Convention.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Annual 
 Decline %</span> - Annual Depreciation rate (if Declining Balance is selected 
 as the Depreciation model.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Useful 
 Life (Years)</span> - The duration the Depreciation is applied over.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Convention</span> 
 - Defines when the Depreciation calculations are performed - Mid Month, 
 Mid Quarter or Mid Year. </li>
            <li class="Bullets"><b>UOP Consolidation</b> - Define the reserve consolidation to be used in the economic assumptions for UOP Reserve Consolidations DD&amp;A calculations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The values that are defined for Depreciation in the Configuration are 
 applied by default to any Expenditure (based on the Jurisdiction and or 
 Economic group assigned to the Project). </p>
        <p>Depreciation can be overridden at the Project level in the <a href="../../Project Editor/Expenditures/Project_Expenditure_Depreciation.htm">Expenditure 
 tab</a> here.</p>
