        <h1>Price Model</h1>
        <p>The calculation of Revenue in esi.manage is comprised of three systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">Production Calculations 
 for a particular Asset</li>
            <li class="Bullets">Product Quality (when Prices 
 are expressed in quality dependant units, like $/mmbtu)</li>
            <li class="Bullets">Price Profile</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other topics describe the <a href="../../Reference/Production_Calculations.htm">Production Calculation</a> 
 and <a href="Product_Qualities.htm">Product Quality</a> components of esi.manage. </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effective 
 Price</span> – the particular product price that is calculated for a particular 
 Price Forecast.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Price 
 Forecast</span> – made up of root forecasts and price adjustment forecasts. 
 &#160;The root 
 price is generally the base price for a specific product (i.e. NYMEX for 
 Gas, WTI for Oil) and is entered as a single number. &#160;A 
 price adjustment is nested off of a root price (or off of another price 
 adjustment)</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Price 
 Adjustment</span> – a two part entry (Scalar and Offset) that represents 
 the desired adjustment at a particular date.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Price 
 Details</span> – a time series of Price Adjustments for a particular Price 
 Forecast.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scenario</span><span> 
 - a way of declaring different values for your existing forecasts. (i.e. 
 high price, low price, archived prices)</span>
            </li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Profiles</span> 
 – price forecasts can be combined into profiles based on % of production, 
 or based on volume amounts, which will then give an effective price based 
 on the different forecasts provided.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tier</span><span> 
 - ties a forecast to a specific profile and specifies the allocation of 
 that forecast. &#160;Tiers 
 are allocated and resolved sequentially.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Effective Price</h3>
        <p>The "Effective Price" is what will be used to calculate the 
 Revenue for a particular product. In the following screen shot, the highlight 
 is on a particular Price Forecast (Rockies - Gas), at a particular period 
 of time (January 2010). </p>
        <p>The bottom of the screen shows how the "Price" (USD/mmbtu) 
 will be determined:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">NYMX Gas is the 
 root Price Forecast.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">For this particular 
 Scenario (Current Prices), NYMX Gas has a Price of $5.02 USD/mmbtu.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Rockies Gas is 
 a Price Forecast which has been related to NYMX Gas. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">It has a Scale 
 of 1, and an offset of -0.25. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Effective 
 Price for the Rockies Gas Forecast is 4.77 USD/mmbtu. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">A Price Adjustment 
 is made up of two parts:</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scale</span> 
 - which is a fractional multiplier.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offset</span> 
 - which is a numeric offset applied after the multiplier.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A Global Forecast, such as "AB Par Price Oil", defines the currency 
 unit and basis (mcf, bbl, mmbtu) for all Price Forecasts which are derived 
 from it. </p>
        <p>Global Forecasts don't have a Scale, only a Price.</p>

        <p>The Pricing Model is configured through four nodes within the Configuration:</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scenarios</span> 
 are a "named" set of Prices, and Scale and Offset Modifier.</li>
            <li class="Bullets">All Forecasts are accessible 
 to each Scenario. However, the Forecast Details can be modified for each 
 Scenario to enable Price Sensitivity analysis</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Defaults</span> 
 allow specific Price Profiles to be assigned to each Product. This will 
 initialize each Product with a Price Forecast.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forecasts</span> 
 are where the hierarchical relationships between Price Forecasts are defined. 
 </li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Profiles</span> 
 are where the functional (contract) relationships between Price Forecasts 
 are defined.</li>
