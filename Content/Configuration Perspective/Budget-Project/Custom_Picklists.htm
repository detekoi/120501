        <p>To Create a new Custom <span style="font-weight: bold;">Picklist</span>, 
 click on the Add - Custom Picklist button <img src="../../Images/add_new_cust_attrib_button.PNG" />on the middle of the screen.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">You will be prompted 
 to enter a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span>. The PickList 
 name is what will appear when configuring a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom 
 Attribute</span> that is a PickList.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Click OK to create 
 the picklist.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Supply the necessary 
 information for the Pick List entries:</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">Sort Order 
 controls how the entries will appear in the list (when be selected within 
 a Project). This will bring the most common selections earlier in the 
 list.</li>
                <li class="NumberedList">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabled</span> flag allows pick list entries 
 to be 'retired' - they are still in the list (to support older projects 
 where the entry was selected), but prevents the items selection in the 
 future.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Custom_Picklists1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Custom Picklist(s) you create will be available as a selection from 
 the Custom Attribute screen.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Create a new 
 Custom Attribute with a Picklist attribute type.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Choose the Picklist 
 you require from the Pick list properties. You can also choose a default 
 selection from the list.</li>
        </ol>

            <img src="../../Images/Add_new_custom_attribute.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Custom Attribute will appear on <span>the screen you select, in 
 this case it will appear on the Project Attributes screen inside the project.</span> If the Entity Type was Asset, it would appear on the bottom of the Asset page of a project when an Asset is selected.  If Budget was chosen, it would appear on the Budget page in Configuration, when a Budget is selected.</p>
