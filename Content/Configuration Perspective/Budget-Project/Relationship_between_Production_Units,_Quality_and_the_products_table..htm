        <h1>Relationship between Production Units, Quality and the Products Table</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>It is difficult to tease apart the interplay between the Production 
 Units table, the Product Qualities table, and the Products table in Configuration. 
 This document is an attempt to document the relationships between the 
 entries and values in the three tables.</p>
        <p>Each table is discussed in turn and the final section provides examples 
 of how esi.manage uses the tables to infer calculated values.</p>
        <p>See the <a href="../../Reference/Production_Calculations.htm">Calculations 
 Reference Guide</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Production 
 Units Table</h3>
        <p>Users define production units in the Production Units table. The user 
 must supply a conversion factor to one of the fundamental esi.manage units.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Relationship_between_production_units_quality_and_the_products_table1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The fundamental units in esi.manage are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gas</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cubic metres (m3) for volume</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Joules (J) for energy</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-Gas</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cubic metres (m3) for volume</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Kilograms (kg) for mass</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Equivalence</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Barrels of oil equivalent (boe)</p>
        <p>Gas is called “energy” in esi.manage. For instance, the Products configuration 
 table has an Energy column that one uses to specify whether the product 
 is Gas or Non-Gas. Equivalence production units are used when reporting 
 both Gas and Non-Gas products in one number. The typical equivalence production 
 unit is boe or mboe but &#160;the 
 user can define other equivalence production units as required.</p>
        <p>Every production unit entered in the Production Units table must have 
 a conversion factor to exactly one of the fundamental units. By and large 
 these conversion factors are basic physical facts so finding the right 
 conversion factor is merely a matter of looking it up in an appropriate 
 reference. (An exception is cf to m3 conversion. It should be 3.283 (0.0283168) 
 but in the SMOG db it is 0.02817399)</p>
        <p>Reading the Production Units table is intuitive. The conversion is always 
 from one user-defined production unit to X fundamental units. E.g. 1 cf 
 = 2.817399E-2 m3 (energy).</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Product 
 Qualities Table</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;">
            <img src="../../Images/Relationship2.png" style="width: 1003px;height: 598px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">The 
 entries in the Product Qualities table are used to convert from the fundamental 
 esi.manage unit ratios to some user defined ratio.</p>
        <p class="warning"><b>WARNING:</b> 
 The Description field is merely text for descriptive purposes only. It 
 plays no role in any calculations.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">However, 
 it is best practice to enter text that describes the conversion. For instance, 
 the table claims that 37,447.9 J / m3 = 1 btu / cf. The conversion factor 
 was calculated (and should be calculated) based on data from the Production 
 Units table. This is how the foregoing conversion was calculated:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">(1 
 btu/cf)×(1055.056 J/btu)/(0.02817399 m^3/cf)=37,447.9J/m^3 </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">The 
 J / btu and m3 / cf conversion factors come from the Production Units 
 table. The btu / cf factor was included to make the units work out.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Products 
 Table</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;">
            <img src="../../Images/Relationship3.png" style="width: 1231px;height: 435px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">We 
 will use the Gas product as our example for this section. The other products 
 follow the same rules. Working the examples below with other products 
 is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Quality</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">The 
 Quality Unit – btu/cf – links to the Product Qualities table entry with 
 that description. That was the entry used in the example above. Remember 
 that the description plays no role in the calculations. So, how does the 
 Quality value – 1060.0 – make sense when it is unit-less?</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">It 
 only makes sense, i.e. has a valid value and units, if one assumes that 
 the conversion factor in the Product Qualities table was arrived at in 
 a very specific way. That is, in the manner described in the previous 
 section. Because of the way the conversion factor was calculated, we know:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 btu⁄cf=37,447.9 J⁄m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Therefore, 
 gas that has a quality value of 1060 btu / cf will have a quality value 
 in fundamental esi.manage units of:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1060×37,447.9 
 &#160;J⁄m^3 
 =39,694,774J⁄m^3 </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Boe</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">The 
 Units/boe value and the Unit value work together in a straight-forward 
 manner to specify a conversion of the product to the fundamental esi.manage 
 equivalence unit – boe. In the example screenshot above, there are 6.0 
 mcf per boe.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">The 
 conversion factors in the Production Units table can be used to convert 
 boe to other equivalence units such as mcfe. Therefore, be consistent 
 in your choice of conversion factors because 1 mcfe should equal 1 mcf! 
 Our examples are consistent. The Products table claims 6.0 mcf / boe and 
 the Production Units table says 1 boe = one sixth (0.1666667) mcfe.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Gas 
 Volume (e3m3 (G))</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Question: 
 500 cf = X e3m3 (G)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 the Production Units table:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 cf = 0.02817399 m3 (energy)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 e3m3 (G) = 1000.0 m3 (energy)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">So: 
 </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">500 
 cf×0.02817399 &#160;m^3⁄cf÷1000.0m^3⁄(e3m3 
 (G)=0.014087e3m3 (G))</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Gas 
 Energy (btu)</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Question: 
 500 cf of 950 Quality btu/cf gas = X btu</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Step 
 1: Calculate how many m3 of gas there is:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 Gas Volume example above: 500 cf = 0.014087 e3m3 (G)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 Production Units table: 1 e3m3 (G) = 1000 m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">500 
 cf = 14.087 m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Step 
 2: Calculate the number of J / m3:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 Products Quality table: the btu/cf conversion factor is 37,447.9 J / m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">The 
 quality number is given in the Calculator as 950</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">950 
 * 37,447.9 J / m3 = 35,575,505 J / m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Step 
 3: Calculate the number of btus:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 the Production Units table: 1 btu = 1055.05676 J</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">(14.087 
 m3 * 35,575,505 J / m3 ) / (1055.05676 J / btu) = 475,000.3 btu</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Equivalence</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Question: 
 500 cf of gas = X GJe</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 the Products table: 6 mcf of gas = 1 boe</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 the Production Units table:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">We 
 can calculate that 1 mcf = 1000 cf</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 GJe = 5.689 boe</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">500 
 cf *(1 mcf / 1000 cf) * (1 boe / 6 &#160;mcf) 
 * (1 GJe / 5.689 boe) = 0.0146815 GJe</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Non-gas 
 Mass</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Question: 
 500 cf of gas = X T of condensate (metric tonnes)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">To 
 solve this, we need to go from a Gas Volume to a Non-gas Volume to a Non-gas 
 mass. First, we calculate to boe of the gas. Since the condensate volume 
 also has a boe equivalence we work backwards from boe to calculate the 
 volume of condensate. At this point we have moved from a Gas Volume to 
 a Non-gas Volume.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Now, 
 we use the Quality of the condensate to calculate the mass of the condensate. 
 We are now at a Non-gas mass and just need to use the conversions in the 
 Production Units table to complete the calculation.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Calculated 
 equivalences (actual calculations left as an exercise to the reader): 
 </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">500 
 cf = 1 / 12 boe</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 bbl condensate = 1 boe</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Therefore, 
 500 cf gas = 1 / 12 bbl condensate</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Calculated 
 non-gas volume (actual calculations left as an exercise to the reader):</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 /12 bbl condensate = 0.0132489 m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 the Products table:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Condensate 
 quality is 650.2 for kg/m3 Product Quality</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 the Product Quality table:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 kg/m3 = 1 kg/m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Therefore, 
 condensate is 650.2 kg / m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Now, 
 we can calculate the number of kilograms of condensate:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">0.0132489 
 m3 * 650.2 kg / m3 = 8.614462 kg</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">From 
 the Production Units table:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1 
 T = 1000 kg</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">So, 
 500 cf of gas = 0.008614462 T</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Non-gas 
 Volume</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Question: 
 500 cf of gas = X m3</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">The 
 solution was already calculated as an intermediate step in the Non-gas 
 Mass section.</p>
