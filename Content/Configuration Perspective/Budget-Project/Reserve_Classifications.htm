        <h1>Reserve Classifications</h1>
        <h3>Configuring Reserves</h3>
        <p>esi.manage supports configuring Reserves to support a number of use 
 cases.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Cumulative 
 Function</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">By 
 leaving the 'Reserve classifications are incremental' box unchecked when 
 production is entered into the production tab of the project editor, the 
 production data will automatically be populated into the next reserve 
 classification.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">This 
 supports:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">1P 
 / P90 = Proved Reserves (P1) (Proven developed, Proven Undeveloped, Proven 
 Developed not producing))</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">2P 
 / P50 = 1P + Probable Reserves (P2)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">3P 
 / P10 = 2P + &#160;Possible 
 Reserves (P3)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">
            <img src="../../Images/aimage109.jpg" style="border: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">
            <img src="../../Images/Reserve_class_prodn_table.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Above 
 is a very simplistic example. By entering in 100 into '1P', 100 is also 
 populated into the next classification of '2P' which is displayed in green 
 font to show it was automatically populated. This saves the user from 
 entering the same data into each of the reserve classes as often 2P will 
 be the same as 1P as there is no Probable reserves etc.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">We 
 then entered 150 into 3P which is why that column is not green.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">The 
 screen shot below shows how this was configured in the Reserves Classification 
 page with the 'Reserve Classifications are incremental' box unchecked.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;">
            <img src="../../Images/Reserve_class_non_incremental.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Incremental 
 Function</h3>
        <p>However, in other configurations which need to split out the P1 (Proven 
 Reserves) into incremental layers, it would not make sense to auto-populate 
 the data from one reserve classification to the next.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>P1 - Proved Developed Producing (PDP)</p>
        <p>P1 - Proved Undeveloped (PUD)</p>
        <p>P1 - Proved Developed Not Producing (PDNP)</p>
        <p>P2 - Possible Reserves</p>
        <p>P3 - Probable reserves</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/reserve_class_consolidation2.PNG" style="border: none;float: none;width: 882px;height: 476px;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="882" height="476" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In this example the production will not automatically be populated a 
 P1 Reserve Classification to another. &#160;However, 
 P2 and P3 do not have the incremental box checked (not shown), and so 
 will automatically be populated by whatever entry is in any of the P1 
 Classifications.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Reserve 
 Consolidations</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;text-decoration: none;">Reserves 
 are reported and analyzed in the esi.manage reports and Production analysis 
 view using consolidations. Within each Reserve category, you may wish 
 to model the High (P90 / 3P), Medium (P50 / 2P) and Low scenarios (P10 
 / 1P) and calculate the mean of the distribution using a Swanson’s mean 
 type consolidation.</p>
        <p>There is also a consolidations tab. This contains all the reserve classifications 
 from all tabs to allow the user to create global consolidations if required.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Expected 
 Value</h3>
        <p>On the Reserve Consolidations section, you are able to choose a Reserve 
 Consolidation that is your Expected Value (EV). &#160;The 
 EV is denoted by a gold star.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/EV_star.png" style="border: none;width: 348px;height: 186px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="348" height="186" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>The EV is important when using the Reserve Progression Feature in Reports. 
 If you choose the Reserve Progression option, as time progresses any Reserve 
 Consolidation you choose to report on (eg. 1P) will progress towards the 
 EV value.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Parametric 
 Mean definition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Parametric Mean Definition is used to calculate the mean of the 
 parameters and then calculate the profile as opposed to calculating the 
 mean of the profiles</li>
            <li>The advantage of this is that it will calculate the mean end point 
 rather than having to take the P1, P2 or P3 points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/aimage40.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up the Parametric Mean in the Reserves Configuration for each 
 Classification.</li>
            <li>Like all consolidations it can be used for Reporting and Charting</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Parametric Mean should only be used for pure Formulaic data – not where Tabular 
 is used</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"><b>&#160;Note:</b> In addition to the above configuration, the <a href="../Fiscal Modeling/Default_Economic_Properties.htm">default 
 economic properties</a> also requires the reserve consolidation to be 
 set.</p>
