        <h1>Price Profiles</h1>
        <p>The purpose of a Price Profile is to tie a Price Forecast to a production 
 stream at the project level. &#160;A 
 Price Profile is made up of one or more tiers. &#160;A 
 tier ties a Price Forecast to a specific relative or absolute value of 
 production. &#160;The 
 minimum number of tiers that a Profile requires is one.</p>

            <li>Profile Name – This name must be unique amongst other Profile names</li>
            <li>Fiscal Model – This is the level at which you are creating the Profile.  If you choose Global, it can be selected as the Price Profile for any Project in your database.  If you choose to set it for a specific Jurisdiction, you cannot use this Profile for Projects that do not fit underneath that Jurisdiction.</li>
            <li>Production Unit &amp;&#160;Currency – These are used to filter down the list of Forecasts available to choose from in the bottom window of this dialog box.  You will only see Forecasts that use the same values available as options to populate the Price Profile with prices.</li>
            <li>Default – Check this box to enable the bottom window.  This is required if you want to automatically populate the Profile with the prices laid out in a Price Forecast.  The options that are available to you to depend on the production unit and currency selected above.</li>
