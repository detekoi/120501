        <h1>Ownership</h1>
        <p>Ownership or working interest can be configured for each project in 
 the <a href="../../Project Editor/Ownership/Ownership_Overview.htm">Ownership tab</a> of the project 
 editor or a default can be set up so that ownership is applied across 
 all projects that have the associated project hierarchy attributes.</p>
        <p>For example, the screen shot below shows the Ownership screen in the 
 defaults folder of the configuration. The Hierarchy 
 selection page (Configuration&gt;Defaults&gt;Hierarchy Selection allows 
 you to determine the level that default ownership is applied. For example, 
 you could base it on the Jurisdiction or the region of the hierarchy etc.</p>
        <p>&#160;These 
 hierarchy nodes are configured in the <a href="../Budget-Project/Project_Hierarchy.htm">Project 
 Hierarchy</a> page in Configuration&gt;Budget Project&gt;Project folder.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can enter one, two or all three of the hierarchy selections. For 
 example, in the example above, I could select Cecilia as the region and 
 not select an area or asset team. I could then apply a WI% which would 
 be applied to all projects with the Cecilia selected as the region in 
 the project hierarchy.</p>
        <p>By changing the selection in the Ownership Hierarchy settings list, 
 the associated hierarchy setting will be displayed in the lower table 
 where the WI% is set.</p>
        <p>You can then add ownership WI% by Hierarchy to all measures or specifically 
 to different Expenditure types, products or Fixed OPEX.</p>
        <p>By typing a WI% value into the cells, esi.manage will automatically 
 populate the same number for all subsequent years and months.</p>
        <p>To change from an annual to a monthly view, click the 'monthly' button 
 in the top right hand corner of the lower part of the Ownership screen.</p>
