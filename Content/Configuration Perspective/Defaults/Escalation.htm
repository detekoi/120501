        <h1>Escalation</h1>
        <p>The Escalation page is where you define the percentage rate at which 
 costs will go up over time. This can be applied to CAPEX/Expenditure categories, 
 OPEX and also prices. Resource costs can also be escalated.</p>
        <p>The escalation page works by selecting a Jurisdiction and or an economic 
 group from the Escalation hierarchy. Against this selection, an escalation 
 file is applied which means that multiple escalation scenarios can be 
 applied for each Jurisdiction or economic group.</p>
        <p>The box under the Escalation Hierarchy allows you to search for the 
 Jurisdiction or economic group you are looking for.</p>

        <p>In the screen shot above you can see a series of buttons. These allow 
 you to add, delete, rename and duplicate the escalation files.</p>
        <p>The columns in the Currency Escalation table are arranged by:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><a href="../Budget-Project/Expenditure_Categories.htm">Expenditure 
 Categories</a> (A&amp;D through to GEN inclusive)</li>
            <li>OPEX (All OPEX types)</li>
            <li>Prices</li>
            <li>Resource</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By typing a number into one of the cells, esi.manage will automatically 
 populate the same number through all subsequent months and years until 
 a new number is entered. Entered numbers appear in bold and automatically 
 populated numbers appear in light grey. &#160;See<a href="../../Reference/Cost_Escalation.htm"> Currency Escalation Calculations</a> 
 for a more detailed description of how the supplied values are used in 
 calculations.</p>
