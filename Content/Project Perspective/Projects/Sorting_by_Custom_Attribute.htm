        <h2>Sorting by Custom Attribute</h2>
        <p>Custom attributes can be added as columns to the Project List. &#160;This 
 adds a new layer of sorting of projects to the project list.</p>
        <p>Custom attributes must be configured properly before they will be visible 
 as columns in the Project List. &#160;To 
 see how to configure the custom attributes please see <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;"><a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Budget-Project/Custom_Attribute_Types.htm">Configuring Custom Attributes.</a></span></p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;esi.manage needs to be restarted after <b>Display in Tables</b> has been selected in configuration for settings to be applied.</p>
        <p>As you can see in the screen shot below, there are two columns that 
 have been added to the project list, Drilling Days and Mandatory (1 Yes, 
 0 No). &#160;Currently 
 The project list is being sorted by drilling days in descending order.</p>
