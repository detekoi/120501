        <h2>Template Well Scheduler Overview</h2>
        <p>It is becoming increasingly common that some portion of a company's 
 Drilling program will include a large number of relatively fast, repetitive 
 Drills in a specific geographic region. esi.manage provides a powerful 
 feature (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Template Schedule Editor</span>) 
 to assist planners in the analysis and scheduling of these drills.</p>
        <p>This tool can be used to create a schedule for any type of Project (conventional 
 or program drilling).</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The basic process is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Create a Budget(s) 
 that will contain the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Templates</span>, 
 and identify this Budget(s) as being <span style="font-weight: bold;">Template 
 Projects Only</span>. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Create (or clone) 
 individual Projects into that Budget. Provide the necessary information 
 to represent the Activity and it's outcome - i.e., Expenditure amounts 
 and duration, Production profiles, Reserves, OPEX, and Resources. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Each Project 
 has a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Template Type</span> - either <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Projects</span> (in which case each Virtual 
 Project is created as a stand-alone), or <span style="font-weight: bold;">New 
 Assets Divided into 1-year Projects</span> (each new Asset that falls 
 within a specific year will be contained within a single Project)</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">With that Budget 
 (Template Well Source) set as the Active Selection, open the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Template 
 Scheduler Editor</span> from the Projects Perspective. You will be required 
 to select a Target Forecast that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual 
 Projects</span> will be created in, and the granularity that you wish 
 to schedule the projects (Daily, Monthly).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Scheduler 
 will be initialized with whatever Template Projects you had visible - 
 for example if you had used the Project Browser filters to show only Projects 
 from a certain Asset Team or Region, those are what will be displayed 
 in the Scheduler.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data 
 Matrix interface</span> is used for this feature - the values that are 
 entered into a particular calendar period indicate how many instances 
 should be created. You can use the Copy and Paste capabilities of the 
 Data Matrix to populate the grid. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Once the desired 
 number of wells have been entered, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> 
 button will result in the Projects and Assets being created with the indicated 
 frequency. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Projects 
 that are Created are termed '<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual 
 Projects</span>' - their data is real but they retain a relationship to 
 the Type Well that they were based on. This connection allows subsequent 
 changes to the Schedule to replace the Virtual Projects accordingly. Updates 
 to a Template Well's information (different Production characteristics 
 for example) can be replicated in the Virtual Projects by re-applying 
 the Schedule.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">As long as a 
 Project is Virtual, it cannot be worked with directly. Once the plan for 
 a particular period in time has been established, Projects can be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Promoted</span> from a Virtual to a Real Project. 
 After this, the Project can be edited - and it will not be impacted by 
 any subsequent use of the Scheduler.</li>
        </ol>
