        <h2>Updating Virtual Projects</h2>
        <p>Projects created via the Template Scheduler are created as a type of 
 project called a Virtual Project. This means that these Projects have 
 a relationship with the Template Project that they were created from.</p>
        <p>If you open the Template Scheduler at some time in the future (after 
 Virtual Projects have been created), esi.manage will find all Virtual 
 Projects for each of the selected Template Projects and display them in 
 the Scheduler, based on the current Periodicity and Focus Period. The 
 Instances at this point will be Black - these projects exist.</p>

 down through all Virtual Project instances, you can select the corresponding lines of the schedule and click on the wrench icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/TemplateScheduler_13402_3.png" /> labeled “Rebuild the selected template schedules”. After confirming that you wish to recreate to the latest template, esi.manage will regenerate the schedules of all the selected lines.</li>
