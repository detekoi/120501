        <h2>Promoting a Virtual Project</h2>
        <p>Projects created from the Template Scheduler are created as Virtual 
 Projects. The Project Content exists in the individual Projects and can 
 be reported on, however, the Virtual Projects cannot be edited. The Project 
 Browser/Navigator will have an additional Filter option - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project 
 Template</span>. This list will show which Project Templates have associated 
 Virtual Projects within the Budget.</p>
        <p>These Virtual Projects will be shown in italics in the Project Browser, 
 and all content within the Project will similarly be italicized. You must 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Promote a Virtual Project</span> in order 
 to edit it's values (including bringing in Actuals against it). Once a 
 Project has been Promoted, it will no longer be impacted by any generated 
 through the Template Scheduler.</p>
