        <h2>Creating the Template Projects</h2>
        <p>Template Projects to be used as the Source for the Template Scheduler 
 must be created in a Budget that has been designated as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Template 
 Source</span>. This flag is set in the Configuration for the particular 
 Budget.</p>
        <p>Any of available approaches - <a href="../Projects/Add_Project.htm" target="_popup">Creating a New Project</a>, 
 <a href="../Projects/Cloning_a_Project.htm" target="_popup">Cloning</a>, 
 or <a href="../../Project Editor/Assets/Clone_a_Well.htm" target="_popup">Cloning an Asset</a> 
 can be used to create a Template Project. </p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As shown, a Template Project can either be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New 
 Projects</span> - any new Projects created via the Scheduler from this 
 Project will contain only one instance of the data within this Project, 
 i.e.; one drilling activity and the corresponding Production, OPEX, Reserves, 
 etc.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New 
 Assets Divided into 1-year Projects</span> - once the Scheduler has been 
 instructed to create the Virtual Projects, it will create individual Assets 
 for each of the activities in a single project, based on the Year. For 
 example, if 12 instances were specified for a given year, there will be 
 12 copies of this project's data within the single Project - individual 
 Assets with the corresponding Project Data scheduled accordingly. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;You could 
 have two copies of each of the Template Sources - one with New Projects 
 and the other with New Assets. The New Projects version could be used 
 for Scheduling the next year's activities, while the New Assets could 
 be used for the Plan in subsequent years.</p>
