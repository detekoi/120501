        <h2>Project Aggregation</h2>
        <p>After clicking <b>Next&gt;</b>, the Project Aggregation window appears. Here are customizable options for aggregated project(s) such as Calculations, Reserve Consolidations, and Forecast Version.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Selecting <b>Economic Truncation</b> will use economic limit dates from the selected consolidation. This implies that the economic limit dates have to be calculated prior to running the aggregation.</p>
        <p>Selecting <b>Effective Royalty</b> will activate the <b>Price Scenarios</b>. It is calculated as a ratio of net production minus net-net production by gross production.</p>
        <p>Selecting <b>Effective Price</b> will activate the <b>Price Scenarios</b> and <b>Currency File</b>. It is calculated as a ratio of revenue (per product, per asset) to production volume (per product, per asset). Default production volume unit for the product is used and the currency is taken from the target budget.</p>
        <p>Changing <b>Forecast Version</b> from <b>Forecast</b> to <b>Blended</b> will activate the <b>Blending Options</b>.</p>
        <p>After desired options have been selected, clicking finish will aggregate the projects and proceed to the <b>Project Aggregation Results</b> window. This overview confirms which projects were converted into assets, or which projects were grouped into new projects.</p>
        <p>Please note that after aggregation, the economics for non-aggregated projects will vary as expected, unless for the simplest cases.</p>
