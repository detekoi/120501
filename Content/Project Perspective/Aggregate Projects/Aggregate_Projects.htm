        <h2>Project Aggregator</h2>
        <p>The project aggregation function allows you to combine multiple projects 
 into a single project aggregating all the assets and measures (production, 
 OPEX and CAPEX) into a new project (or projects).</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Aggregation Exclusions</h3>
        <p>Field estimates and Actuals are not part of project aggregation. Derived 
 by products will not be aggregated.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Production Aggregation</h3>
        <p>The following fields must be the same in production in order to aggregate 
 them:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Product</li>
            <li>Production Rate</li>
            <li>Quality Unit</li>
            <li>The production must be monthly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The aggregated production data will be tabular. </p>
        <p>All derived associated products will be aggregated as normal products. 
 &#160;Derived 
 by-products will not be aggregated</p>
        <p>The Shrinkage, POS%, and overall quality will be calculated.</p>
        <p>The quality from a production segment that uses equivalence units is discarded during project aggregation. As a result, for the period of time where the production segment uses equivalence units, no quality is calculated.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Production Exclusions</h3>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Comments, 'Dependent On' and Price Profile will 
 not be aggregated.</li>
            <li>Downtime will not be aggregated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Expenditure Aggregation</h3>
        <p>The following fields must be the same in Expenditure in order to aggregate 
 them:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Type &amp; Category</li>
            <li>Status</li>
            <li>Currency</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The expenditure must be on a monthly basis.</p>
        <p>Gross expenditure amount and PD% will be calculated.</p>
        <p>AFE linkage, Comments, dependencies, negative started, and ended are 
 ignored.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>OPEX Aggregation</h3>
        <p>The following fields must be the same in<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"> 
 Fixed OPEX</span> in order to aggregate them:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Category</li>
            <li>Type</li>
            <li>Status</li>
            <li>Product</li>
            <li>Currency</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Time period must be monthly.</p>
        <p>POS% and Gross amount are calculated.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The following fields must be the same in<span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"> 
 Variable OPEX</span> in order to aggregate them</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Category</li>
            <li>Type</li>
            <li>Status</li>
            <li>Product</li>
            <li>Currency</li>
            <li>Production volume unit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Amount per volume is calculated.</p>
        <p>If no production, Variable OPEX will be ignored.</p>
        <p>Status of the OPEX in aggregation result projects is always NULL.</p>
        <p>Variable OPEX(es) are recalculated with respect to Use Sales Volume, and the flag will be always set in the result.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Ownership Aggregation</h3>
        <p>The ownership for expenditures, production and fixed OPEX will be calculated. 
 </p>
        <p>Ownership is calculated at an asset level. &#160;An 
 overall ownership is calculated for each type of measure by gradually 
 summing with the weight corresponding to its part in the total of the 
 measure. &#160;Ownership 
 for a measure in a project will be ignored if there is no data for that 
 measure.</p>
