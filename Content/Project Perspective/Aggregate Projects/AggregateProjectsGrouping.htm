        <h2>Project Grouping</h2>
        <p>After pressing <b>Next&gt;</b> the Project Grouping window will appear.</p>

        <p>Multiple attributes can be assigned to either Project-Level grouping or Asset-level grouping. Here you can group attributes to be aggregated into separate projects based on those attributes, or funnel groupings into assets. Leaving Project-Level attributes will result in a single project being generated. Similarly, empty Asset-Level attributes do the same for assets.</p>
        <p>Project-Level attributes and Asset-Level attributes can be set in a grouping order by using the 'up' <img src="../../Resources/Images/AggregateProjectsFigure5.png" /> and 'down' <img src="../../Resources/Images/AggregateProjectsFigure6.png" /> arrows.</p>
        <p class="example">For example, placing Project into the Asset-Level Attributes will create a single project with an asset for each original project.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Alternatively, if Area is placed into the Project-Level Attributes, multiple projects will be created aggregating the projects with common Area into its own project.</p>
        <p>"Preserve projects as assets" functionality of the external aggregator can be accomplished by selecting "Project" as an asset level grouping attributes. To get the same functionality as "Group assets only", you need to select "Project"&#160;as the project-level attributes and leave asset-level attributes empty.</p>
