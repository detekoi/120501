        <h2>Data Matrix - Update From</h2>
        <p>In addition to Changing data within the Matrix directly, you have the 
 option of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Updating the Forecast</span> 
 from either Field Estimates or Financial Actuals, &#160;including 
 AFE Actuals and Field Estimates.</p>
        <p>The Update Forecast <img src="../../Images/gold_bar_gearwheel.png" style="border: none;border-style: none;float: none;width: 24px;height: 28px;" width="24" height="28" border="0" /> button will open the following dialogue:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Update Forecast.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">If you have selected 
 a <span style="font-weight: bold;">number of Edited cells</span>, this 
 will be indicated in the Dialogue.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 
 Source</span> determines what will be the source for the Forecast Update 
 (Field Estimates or Actuals).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">You can toggle 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update All</span> option, in which 
 case all cells with data will be changed. </li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">Note that 
 if Expenditures (or OPEX Items) were originally scheduled on a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yearly 
 Basis</span>, and you are working with the Matrix on a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Monthly 
 Basis</span>, the Update function will change the schedule based on what 
 is displayed in the Matrix, even if a particular value hasn't been edited. 
 </li>
                <li class="NumberedList">In addition, 
 the Update All option will apply to <span style="font-weight: bold;">all 
 Data</span> within the Matrix - i.e.; if Filtering has been applied it 
 has not removed the data from the Matrix, only the display. </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Update Forecast Date.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You also have the option of applying logic to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintain 
 Totals</span> up to a certain point in time.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Maintain Total 
 will determine the delta between the current Forecast Total (for an Expenditure), 
 and what the new Total will be after Updating the Forecast from the Actuals.
 </li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">This <span style="font-weight: bold;">delta</span> is then applied to the Period 
 beyond the Update window (periods that there are Actuals for), such that 
 the Total Forecast Amount doesn't change.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="NumberedList">Selecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">Until End Of</span> (in conjunction with Maintain 
 Total) will apply this logic, but only up to the selected date (appropriate 
 for multi-year Expenditures where you are wanting to control the adjustments 
 to within the current year). </li>
            <ul>
                <li class="NumberedList">For example, 
 if there is a 3 year Expenditure at 10,000,000 per year, and the Actuals 
 for the first six months of the year are 4,000,000, selecting Maintain 
 Total to Dec 2010 will apportion the Delta (1,000,000) over the remainder 
 of this year.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The option <b>Source Date Until</b> specifies to which date the source's data will be copied over the forecast data. It works in conjunction with the Maintain Totals option. The drop down menu housing the dates is inclusive. </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">This proves useful, for example, if 8 months of source data are available but only the first 6 months are to be updated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">There has been another option added within the Update Actual with Field Estimates, this is the Convert Nominal to Real option, this will covert the Nominal values within the Data Matrix into Real Values. </p>
