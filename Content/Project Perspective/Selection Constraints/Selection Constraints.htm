        <h2>Selection Constraints</h2>
        <p>The Selection Constraints tab on the Projects Perspective is for use with the esi.portfolio integration. If you have esi.portfolio, populating this table will populate the export file from esi.manage Analysis results with selection constraints. Changes made in this table will have no effect on data or calculated results inside the esi.manage application.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This table has the same rules applied to it as the selection constraints table in esi.portfolio (and Perspectives), however there are a few options to help you quickly populate it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy and paste works for patterns in this table, such as copying the first 12 periods, highlighting the next 10 years, and pasting in a repeating pattern.</li>
            <li>Clicking the "Set Max = 1" button <img src="../../Images/SC_set_max_1.png" /> will set the max for the total and all periods to 1, and leave the minimum at 0.</li>
            <li>"Clear Rows" button <img src="../../Images/SC_clear_row.png" /> will delete all entries in a given row</li>
            <li>The arrows <img src="../../Images/SC_arrows.png" /> will move your focus to the beginning or end of data entered in the row you have highlighted.</li>
        </ul>
