        <h1>Evaluation Files<img src="Images/Logo Images/3esi_manage.png" align="right" border="0" class="HeaderLogo" /></h1>
        <p>Evaluation Files are created through the Navigator and can be used in several areas of the application.</p>
        <p>The files are based on the Analysis information found when creating a new Analysis case and can be set as the Global defaults within the Evaluation files criteria. </p>
        <p>These files allow the user to group selected parameters together as global settings for ease of use.</p>
        <p>To create a sensitivity file, right click in the Navigator and select <b>New- Evaluation File.</b></p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Give your new File a proper name and select Next.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The Evaluation File consists of 4 separate parameters.</p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: normal;" class="NumberedList"><b>Custom Economic Calculations</b>- in this section you can select the parameters spreadsheet to be used with the spreadsheet economics engine. It may be left blank if spreadsheet economics are not being used.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data 
 Truncation</span> - defines the Span (number of years) of years to use for the generated 
 Cash Flow, and the Start Date (explicit Point Forward Date or Full Cycle of the Projects). This section also allows the User to define 
 the Economic Truncation method (either Calculated, Asset Economic Limit Date, 
 or No Truncation), whether to use custom user-defined truncation formula (if Calculated), and whether or not there is any Income Loss Carry Forward 
 for tax purposes.
 </li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discounting 
 Options</span> - User defines when the start date for economic discounting; the Discount Rate to apply; whether it is to be Mid Year (only valid with Yearly discounting), and whether to Retroactively apply discounting to cashflows that occur prior to the "Economic Discounting as of" date.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display 
 Settings</span> - User defines: date of which the real currency is being calculated on.</li>

        <p>Once the parameters have been filled the user will see their Sensitivity Files within the Navigator in the Private folder. </p>

        <h3>Global Parameters</h3>
        <p>The newly created Evaluation Files are applied within several areas of the application for economic evaluations.</p>
        <p>The Global Parameter found below the windows tool bar allows the user to set sensitivity files and evaluation files that will be used for all economic runs within esi.manage.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</p>
        <p>By setting the Global Parameters with these files, the user will overwrite all uses of other Sensitivity or Evaluation files that exist previously in Analysis Cases or where these files may be in use.</p>
