        <h1>Quick Find Search Engine</h1>
        <p>At the top of the Project Browser there is a text box that is used to 
 automatically filter the Project Browser based on a text string supplied.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The searching 
 is applied to any node that has been "<span style="font-weight: bold;">activated</span>", 
 such as Hierarchy shown below.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">All 'elements' 
 under every active node are examined for matching against the supplied 
 string.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Since there is 
 a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corp</span>orate Region (under Hierarchy), 
 as well as a Project Manager <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corp</span>orate 
 Management, both are found. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Browser will 
 remain in this state as long as the Text String is still in the cell.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Any of the nodes can be selected to make them an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Active 
 Filter</span>.</li>
