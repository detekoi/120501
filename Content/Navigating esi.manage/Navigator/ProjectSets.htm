        <h1>Project Sets</h1>
        <p>Project sets are saved project filters and/or selections of projects 
 defined by the user. Project sets can be used to keep track of any grouping 
 of projects. The filters can be based on any item that is listed in the Project Browser, such as Hierarchy, Production Onstream Date, Expenditure Forecast Year, etc.</p>
        <p>Use Project Sets in conjunction with Analysis Cases, Reports, Import 
 and Export Jobs for unlimited analysis possibilities.</p>
        <p>Project sets are the main source of organization in esi.manage. Programs, 
 rig lines, favourite projects etc. can be tracked using project sets.</p>
        <p>When defining project sets, they can either be defined as <span style="font-weight: bold;">static</span> 
 or <span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamic. </span>Static sets are selections 
 of individual projects that don't change unless additional projects are 
 manually added in. This type of project set can be created by filtering 
 in the Project Browser by Project, and selecting only the projects you wish 
 to have in the project set. &#160;Dynamic 
 sets on the other hand, update when the projects defined by the filters 
 selected change.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> For example, if Project 
 Manager A is assigned 3 new projects, they will show up if a dynamic filter 
 is set. &#160;This 
 is the typical use case of Project Sets.</span></p>
