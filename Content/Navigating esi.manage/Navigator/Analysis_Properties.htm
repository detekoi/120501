        </h1>
        <p>As described in the <a href="Analysis_Case_Overview.htm"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis Case Overview</span>,</a> companies 
 can define any or all of the Properties within the esi.manage Configuration 
 and decide whether to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock</span> any 
 or all of the Properties in the <a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Economics/Default_Economic_Properties.htm">Configuration</a> 
 perspective. </p>
        <p class="whs3" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">

        <p class="whs3" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="whs3" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Analysis Case is defined 
 on the Properties page and is made up of 7 Sections:</p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><b>Environment</b>- defines the sensitivity file and evaluation file to be used for the calculations. This allows the user to store and share configurations among many analysis cases and modify them all from one single location. If desired, the settings can remain in the analysis case bay leaving the values set at (none). Note that if you select either a sensitivity file or environment file, some of the settings will be disabled as the values from the corresponding file will be used.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: normal;" class="NumberedList"><b>Custom Economic Calculations</b>- in this section you can select the parameters spreadsheet to be used with the spreadsheet economics engine. It may be left blank if spreadsheet economics are not being used.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data 
 Truncation</span> - defines the Span (number of years) of years to use for the generated 
 Cash Flow, and the Start Date (explicit Point Forward Date or Full Cycle of the Projects). This section also allows the User to define 
 the Economic Truncation method (either Calculated, Asset Economic Limit Date, 
 or No Truncation), whether to use custom user-defined truncation formula (if Calculated), and whether or not there is any Income Loss Carry Forward 
 for tax purposes.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data 
 Definition</span> - how esi.manage is to generate the Cash Flow; i.e., 
 Forecast or &#160;Blended, 
 Gross, Net, Net Risked; which Price Scenario to use; which Revenue Consolidation 
 to use; whether to apply </li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><b>Sensitivities </b>- <span style="font-weight: normal;">if no sensitivities file is selected, here you specify which Price Scenario to use; whether to apply <b>Escalation</b>; which foreign exchange rates to use (Currency Conversions); if the measures should be scaled according to a user configured</span><a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Defaults/Measure_Scaling.htm">scaling file</a>. 
 </li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discounting 
 Options</span> - User defines when the start date for economic discounting; the Discount Rate to apply; whether it is to be Mid Year (only valid with Yearly discounting), and whether to Retroactively apply discounting to cashflows that occur prior to the "Economic Discounting as of" date.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display 
 Settings</span> - User defines: the granularity (monthly or yearly) of the Cash Flow, and, with monthly data, whether discounting is to be applied Yearly or Monthly; the volume unit or equivalence unit to be used for reporting; and the currency in which to report.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="whs3" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>The environment section allows you to pick from the existing sensitivity files and environment files the corresponding settings to be used for calculation. This allows the user to have a separate configuration files independent from the analysis cases and update all related cases from one single location. This section is optional as you can leave the values set at (none) and all the related configuration will be stored within the analysis case making it independent.</p>
        <p><b>Sensitivity File</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>(global)</b> – this option means that you would like to use the file specified globally in the toolbar. If you change the global sensitivity file in between runs to obtain different sensitivity conditions under the same set of parameters.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Note that the parameters under the sensitivity section will be disabled.</p>
        <h3>
            <img src="../../Images/GlobalParam.png" />
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>(none)</b> – use the parameters specified within the analysis case.</li>
            <li><b>Specific Sensitivity file – The analysis case will always use the current version of the parameters in the sensitivity file.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluation File</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>(global)</b> – this option means that you would like to use the file specified globally in the toolbar. If you change the global environment file in between runs to obtain different environment conditions under the same set of parameter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that the parameters relevant to the environment will be disabled.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>(none)</b> – use the parameters specified within the analysis case.</li>
            <li><b>Specific Environment file – The analysis case will always use the current version of the parameters in the environment file.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <br />
            <h3>Custom Economic Calculations</h3>
            <p>The models used in esi.manage’s custom economics engine can optionally have a spreadsheet with parameters as inputs to the calculation. Within this section the user is able to select the parameters spreadsheet to be delivered to the custom economics engine.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Parameters Spreadsheet</b> – select the preloaded spreadsheet to be used for calculations in the current analysis case. This field is optional and will only have effects on the models that use the spreadsheet parameters feature.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Data Truncation</h3>
        <p>The Cash Flow for the Analysis Case is generated at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Asset 
 Level</span>. The results are then successively <span style="font-weight: bold;">aggregated 
 up</span> - to the Project, each successive level of the Fiscal Mode, the Project Set, and finally Analysis 
 Case. </p>
        <p>The Analysis Schedule defines the Horizon for the calculated Cash Flow 
 for each Asset - these settings are interpreted for each Asset based on 
 its data.</p>

        <h3>Data Definition</h3>
        <p>The Data Definition section of this page defines how the Cash Flow is

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Sensitivities</h3>
        <p>The output of the analysis case can be calculated under different assumptions for product price, currency escalation, currency exchange rates and generally scaling measures such as Production, Opex and Capex. This section will only be enabled if the analysis case is not using a sensitivity file or the global options.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Price Scenario</b> - esi.manage’s price forecasts have different versions called scenarios. Chose the scenario to be used for economic calculations.</li>
            <li><b>Escalation File</b> -  all currency inputs in esi.manage’s projects can escalate due to inflation (or other factors) according to an escalation file. Chose the desired file or (no escalation) to be used in the analysis case.</li>
            <li><b>Exchange File</b> – Since projects can have their inputs in different currencies a currency exchange file must be provided to report the results in the same currency. Since you can have a virtually unlimited number of exchange files, this can be used to model different scenarios and the sensitivity to currency exchange rates.</li>
            <li><b>Scale File</b> – The measures of production, Capex and Opex (fixed and variable) can have a factor applied to them at the time of calculation. Select the scale file or (no scaling) to be applied to this analysis case.</li>
