        <h1>Bulk Editor</h1>
        <p>esi.manage includes a utility to Bulk Edit multiple projects simultaneously. 
 The projects selected for use in this screen need to be selected from 
 the projects list in the projects browser. Select a project, hold down 
 shift and up or down arrow key to select multiple projects next to each 
 other or use the ctrl key to highlight multiple projects in the list. 
 See below.</p>

        <p>This feature allows for groupings to occur while 
 editing large numbers of projects. The new system shows all selected edits 
 in the 'Pending Bulk Edit' section seen at the end of below screen shot. 
 By clicking OK all selected projects will be effected by the collective 
 groupings of Categories selected.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Updating is controlled by the combination of the Category, as well 
 as the desired Description selected. For example, in the screen shown 
 above - the 3 selected Categories will be updated in the Projects while 
 the rest are untouched.</p>
        <p>Based on the configuration of this screen, 9 Projects will:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Have their start 
 date shifted by 165 days</li>
            <li>Have a downtime 
 from start-end of 25</li>
            <li>Have an updated 
 Tabular Scale of Gas increased by a Scale Factor of 6</li>
        </ol>
