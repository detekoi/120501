        <h1>Analysis Case Overview</h1>
        <p>The Analysis feature in esi.manage performs Economics calculations against 
 a Cash Flow for a set of projects. The general calculation process is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Internally generate 
 a Cash Flow (Capital Expenditure, Revenue, Operating Expense) for a selection 
 of Projects for a defined number of years. The Cash Flow can be generated 
 using any of the esi.manage Types (Gross, Net, Net Risked / Forecast, 
 Blended, etc.).</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">With multiple 
 Projects, or Projects with Multiple Assets, the generated Cash Flow is 
 also aggregated at the Asset, Project, Fiscal Model, Project Set, and Analysis 
 Case level.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Apply Discounting 
 (Monthly, Yearly, Mid Period, with Interest in the Past) against the Cash 
 Flow to produce a Discounted Cash Flow at a specified Discount Rate.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Calculate Economic 
 Metrics (ROI, DROI, NPV, Payout, Economic Limit, etc.) against the Cash 
 Flow / Discounted Cash Flow.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Examine the calculated 
 Results, Raw and Discounted Cash Flows, Economic Metrics, either at the 
 individual Asset, Project, Project Set, or Analysis Case level.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Analysis Case calculation engine can be accessed from the Project 
 Ranking perspective such that the Metrics are available to the Ranking 
 criteria. </p>
        <p>Corporate Standards for Economics Calculations (Analysis Period, Discount 
 Rate and Economics Discounting As Of, Mid Period, Default Metrics, etc.) 
 are defined inside of the esi.manage Configuration such that all Analysis 
 Cases begin with the same set of calculation parameters. Company's have 
 the option of locking any of the Default parameters so that they cannot 
 be modified within an individual Analysis Case. </p>
        <p>User Defined Metrics (NPV at a different Discount Rate for example) 
 can be added into any Analysis Case in addition to any Corporate standard 
 metrics. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note That</span>: </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Analysis 
 Case Engine can be accessed in a number of ways. In addition to the Analysis 
 Case, you can Select Projects from the Browser and choose the Analyze 
 Button. At this point you will be prompted to choose which Analysis Case 
 is to be used - i.e., all of its settings (except for the Project or Project 
 Set selection) will be applied against the selected projects.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Multiple Analysis 
 Cases can be selected from the Navigator and be Analyzed together. In 
 this case, the Analysis Settings (Period/Duration/Discounting) for the 
 first Analysis Case will be used for all Analysis Cases such that a consistent 
 set of periodic data is generated.</li>
        </ol>
