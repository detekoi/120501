        <h1>Publish Workflow</h1>
        <p>When you create a New Instance of a Navigator Item, and then Save it, 
 by default it will be Private. As part of the Save process, you will be 
 prompted to select the Private Folder that you wish to Save the new instance 
 under.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Menu_Report_Publish_File.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In order to make an item(s) available to others, you must <span style="font-weight: bold;">Publish</span> 
 the File (shown above).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_PublishFile.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Publish File Dialogue will display all Public Folders under the Items 
 Tree Structure (i.e., if you are Publishing a Report(s), you can only 
 publish them to a Public Folder under the Reports tree).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Publish_a_File_Finished.png" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This Report has now been relocated to the Public Folder. However, this 
 Report is still 'owned' by the user who Created it. Only that user can 
 modify and save that particular instance. While another user can Modify 
 that Report, it will have to be Saved under a different Name - in a Private 
 Folder. The new instance (modified form of the original) will have to 
 be Published again to make it visible to all users.</p>
        <p class="note"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>there is an Option 
 (based on Security settings) for Administrators to change the owner of 
 a Report, Analysis Case or Export Job.</p>
