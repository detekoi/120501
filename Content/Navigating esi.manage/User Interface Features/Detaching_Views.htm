        <h1>Detaching Views</h1>
        <p>This feature is suited to users who have multiple monitors. Certain 
 views within esi.manage (the Analysis Views are a common choice), can 
 be "Detached" from the esi.manage desktop and moved to a separate 
 monitor.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Tab</span> (Production Analysis 
 as shown above) and drag it - as you pass the edge of the esi.manage border, 
 a dashed outline will be shown. Releasing it will move the view outside 
 of esi.manage.</p>
        <p>The view will still retain connection to esi.manage (you can still change 
 settings on the Analysis View and have it recalculated).</p>
        <p>Closing the detached view will return it to it's default behaviour.</p>
