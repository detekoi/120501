        <p>Constraints can be used to model behaviours such as the constraints that 
 a facility imposes on a field. &#160;Constraints 
 in <span style="font-weight: bold;">esi.</span>manage™ are applied to 
 specific products, so that gas can be constrained differently from oil, 
 and so forth. &#160;Groups 
 can be constrained in two different ways:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity</span> 
 – A facility can only process products at certain levels, which can be 
 less than the wells in a field could produce at. &#160;Capacity 
 constraints model the limits a facility places on the production of a 
 field.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Downtime</span> 
 – Groups level downtime can be used to model facility downtime and the 
 effects it has on multiple projects at once.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>To add Constraints to a Product Stream:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Open up a group from the Group Browser – it will 
 open to the Group Details tab.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the Constraints tab.</li>
            <li>Choose a product to add constraints to and set 
 it to active.</li>
            <li>New columns will appear under the Annual Constraint 
 Rate by Product, Value table.</li>
            <li>You can now add a capacity and downtime constraint 
 to the group for the product you have selected by editing the Constraint 
 Table.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>To Remove Constraints from a Product Stream:</h3>
        <p>From the Constraints Tab, select the product you 
 no longer want constrained and press the Delete Constraint Product button.</p>
