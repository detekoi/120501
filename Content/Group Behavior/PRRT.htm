        <h1>PRRT (Petroleum Resource Rent Tax)</h1>
        <p>The Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) is a profit-based tax which is 
 levied on Australian petroleum projects. </p>
        <p>PRRT is currently applied to the recovery of all petroleum products 
 from Australian Government waters (including crude oil, natural gas, liquid 
 petroleum gas (LPG) condensate and ethane), except for petroleum products 
 extracted from the North West Shelf project and the Joint Petroleum Development 
 Area, and value added products such as liquefied natural gas (LNG).</p>
        <p>esi.manage supports the PRRT tax calculation through the use of an economic 
 concession group that is specific to Australia. The PRRT concession group 
 allows you to specify a group of projects and set a number of Expenditure 
 Cost pool rules with associated tax rates. &#160;As 
 part of the economics calculations, PRRT calculation is ring-fenced for 
 the projects that are a part of the group.</p>
