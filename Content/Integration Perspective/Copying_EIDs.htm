        <h2>EIDs and Budget Progression</h2>
        <p>When changing a Budgets Type, EIDs may or may not be copied, depending 
 on the type the budget is changing from/to.</p>
        <p>Budget to Current Forecast: EIDs will be copied over, and will still 
 be mapped to the Asset.</p>
        <p>Current Forecast to Editable Closed Archive: &#160;EIDs 
 will NOT be copied over into the new Budget. &#160;Users 
 can still manually enter EIDs if they choose to import Actuals into Editable 
 Archives.</p>
        <p>Current Forecast to Closed Archive: Any EIDs associated with the Current 
 Forecast will be removed. &#160;</p>
        <p>Editable Closed Archive to Closed Archive: Any EIDs associated with 
 the Editable Archive will be removed. &#160;</p>
