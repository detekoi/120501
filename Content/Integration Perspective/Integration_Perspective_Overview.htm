        <h2>Integration Perspective Overview</h2>
        <p>External Systems, for example Field Capture or Accounting systems, will 
 have a unique identifier that represents a certain Well. This may be a 
 Cost Center, or it may be a form of the well's UWI. </p>
        <p>To streamline the importing of 'Actuals' data into esi.manage, a mechanism 
 has been provided which allows the mapping of an External System Identifier 
 (EID) to a corresponding esi.manage Asset. An EID is made up of two parts, 
 the System, and the Identifier.</p>
        <p>Multiple EIDs can be associated against the same Asset, i.e., one which 
 corresponds to the Field Capture system, and one which corresponds to 
 the Accounting. In addition, a single EID can be mapped against multiple 
 Assets, with a corresponding allocation against Asset.</p>
        <p>The Integration Perspective is where the mapping is occurs. EID information 
 can be entered in manually, or can be <a href="../Importing and Exporting/CSV Import Process/EID_Import_Requirements.htm">Imported</a>.
