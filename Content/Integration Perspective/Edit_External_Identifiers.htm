        <h2>Edit External 
 Identifiers</h2>
        <p>This screen allows you to edit EIDs that you have either already entered 
 or imported through the External Identifier Import.</p>
        <p>This list drives the EIDs that will appear in the list when you search 
 for EIDs in the other screens of the Integration perspective.</p>
        <p>You can add EIDs by filling out the two <span style="font-weight: bold;">bolded</span> 
 mandatory fields.</p>
        <p>You can delete EIDs by selecting one from the table and right clicking 
 and selecting "Delete". You cannot delete EIDs that are currently 
 mapped, they must be unmapped before you are able to delete them.</p>
