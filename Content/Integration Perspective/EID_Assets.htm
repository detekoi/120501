        <h2>Searching Assets &amp; EIDs</h2>
        <p>The Assets screen of the Integration Perspective allows you to search 
 by assets, find External Identifiers, and map the two to each other (and 
 thus their associated production, expenditures, etc.).</p>
        <p>You can use either search (Assets or EIDs) by typing in full or partial 
 name matches. For partial matches, you can use %, * &#160;wildcard 
 operators to complete the end of the name. For anything other than a complete 
 match, you will need to check the "Show All" option to see partial 
 matches.</p>
        <p>Only Assets from Open or Visible budgets will be accessible in the asset 
 list.</p>
        <p>To find assets similar to another asset, right-click on the similar 
 field and select "Find Items Like This". The search criteria 
 defining that characteristic will be added to the search bar. (Eg. +budgetName:"evergreen 
 forecast"). &#160;This 
 is a good way to understand the syntax of the search criteria.</p>
        <p>The "Smart Filter" applies additional search logic when looking 
 for EIDs, you can also choose to ignore EIDs already mapped to other assets 
 (much like the AFE mapping screen).<img src="../Resources/Images/SearchAandEID.png" /></p>
