        <h2>EDL Interface</h2>
        <p>***THIS FEATURE IS BEING DEPRECATED. PLEASE MIGRATE ALL EXCEL DATA LOAD TEMPLATES TO THE NEW FORMAT***</p>
        <p>To start a new template, simply Right-Click in the Navigator pane and select New&gt;Excel Template.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/EDLNavi.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A prompt to name the template will appear as well as the option to house it in the Private folder in the navigator.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/EDLName.png" />
        </p>
        <p>By default, all newly created Excel Templates will go to the user's private folder.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/EDLName2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Note: if the user was not in the Excel Template perspective, then the following message will appear.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/EDLswitch.png" />
        </p>
        <p>However, if in the Excel Template perspective after clicking on finish and selecting the proper folder, the new template will open. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/EDLOverview.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The screen that opens when a template is created is the Overview tab. There are 5 tabs within the EDL template. Depending on the project, 2-5 tabs are mandatory, the most simple requiring only the Overview and Attributes tab, while complex loads may require the use of all 5 tabs.&#160; </p>
        <p>Along the top right of the EDL there are 4 buttons.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ExcelTemplates1/0300000E.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Before a template is created or started, there will only be 1 available, but as the template develops or is completed they all will be accessible. They are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 37pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Open Excel file or bring it to front if already open. Once an Excel file has been uploaded to the template, it can be reopened or brought to the front of screen. This is a copy of the Excel workbook used to create the template – it is not the actual file. The Excel file attached to the template can be altered and saved but will not affect the original document, and vice versa.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Open User Parameters dialog. Once a User Parameter has been defined (discussed later), this button will open the dialog to fill out the parameters with their desired values.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Import Template. When a template has been completed or is in a state which could be used in other templates, it can be exported as a .JSON file. The Import Template button will load a .JSON file and fill out the tabs with the information within.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Import current Excel file into esi.manage. Once the template is complete, it is imported into esi.manage with this button (provided there are no errors within the template).</li>
        </ul>
