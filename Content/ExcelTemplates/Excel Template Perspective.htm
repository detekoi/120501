        <h2>Excel Template Perspective</h2>
        <p>***THIS FEATURE IS BEING DEPRECATED. PLEASE MIGRATE ALL EXCEL DATA LOAD TEMPLATES TO THE NEW FORMAT***</p>
        <p>The Excel Templates Perspective houses the Excel Data Loader.&#160; The Excel Data Loader “(EDL)” is a tool used by esi.manage to extract data from MS Excel documents by way of EDL “templates”. A template is a set of mapping rules which tells esi.manage how to map the spreadsheet into a particular format fit for esi.manage.&#160; Once a template has been defined and tested, it can be stored, shared, and used by authorized persons to import multiple Excel files of the appropriate format into esi.manage. Because of the two-dimensional limitations of Excel, data can only be in one of two formats. The first being single cells to be mapped to single values in esi.manage, also known as non-tabular data. The second being tables containing either “tabular” data and time-based measure data, or tables containing “tabular” attributes only. The EDL is an efficient way to streamline the dataload process. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">To get started, the EDL perspective needs to be enabled. This can be enabled within the <b>Configuration Perspective</b> under <b>System&gt;Miscellaneous&gt;Site-specific Features.</b></p>
