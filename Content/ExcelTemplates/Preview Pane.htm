        <h2>Preview Pane</h2>
        <p>***THIS FEATURE IS BEING DEPRECATED. PLEASE MIGRATE ALL EXCEL DATA LOAD TEMPLATES TO THE NEW FORMAT***</p>
        <p>The preview pane location is coupled with the problems pane. On the preview pane, data can be viewed as it is mapped and before it is loaded. It is in the form of how it will be passed into esi.manage. By hovering over an attribute in the preview pane will display the Excel source cell address or range. For attributes mapped from Excel, double clicking the attribute will highlight it within Excel for correlation. There is a search feature to quickly look up a desired attribute or attribute value.</p>

        <p>(expanded view)</p>
        <p>The preview pane also helps seek out problems. When a problem is encountered, the parent nodes will be highlighted down to the node that holds the error.</p>
