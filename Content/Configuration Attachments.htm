        <h1>Configuration Attachments</h1>
        <p>Configuration attachments allow the user to track multiple Economic Reports, Custom&#160;Economic Models and Custom Economic Parameter files. </p>
        <p>This section of the defaults is used as a repository that other areas within the application can point at to draw data from. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The attachments are uploaded by the user through the buttons located on the top right of the page. </p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Economic Reports</h3>
        <p>Once an economic report has been attached, the user can move to the Excel Report Templates area within Configuration to reference this attachment. Learn more about the specifics of this area within the Excel Report Templates page in the Help File.</p>
