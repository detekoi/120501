        <h2>Synch with PEEP</h2>
        <p>Projects can be Synchronized with PEEP. esi.manage measures (
 production, OPEX and CAPEX are exported to PEEP. The Calculation in PEEP 
 is run and esi.manage then imports the Ownership, Tax, Royalties and economic 
 Metrics from PEEP, while leaving Capital and Operating Expenditures, and 
 Production values in esi.manage intact. &#160;In 
 this way, esi.manage can be used to track forecast and actuals data, while 
 PEEP is used as the economics engine.</p>
        <p>To synch with PEEP</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Select the Project(s)  to be synched 
 with PEEP.</li>
            <li>Initiate the synch action by either invoking the 
 context menu (select projects and right click) and choosing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Synch with PEEP </span>action or by clicking 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Synch with PEEP</span> button <img src="../Images/Synch_with_PEEP.PNG" style="border: none;float: none;width: 14px;height: 15px;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="14" height="15" border="0" /> within each project.</li>
            <li>A dialogue box will open with a list of projects 
 to be synchronized, and a drop down box to select a number of Parameters. 
 (Just like Exporting to Peep)</li>
            <li>It is very important to ensure that the esi.manage 
 economic group (found in details section of the esi.manage project is 
 an exact match to the model name that is linked to the PEEP case for the 
 interface with PEEP to run.</li>
        </ol>
