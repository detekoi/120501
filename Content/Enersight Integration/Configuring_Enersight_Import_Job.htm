        <h2>Configure and Run Enersight Import Jobs</h2>
        <p>In an Enersight Import Job, you must set the following three values:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Target Budget: the esi.manage budget that you want to import data into</li>
            <li>Plan Data Set: the name of the Plan Data Set you wish to import from</li>
            <li>PDS&#160;Version: the version of the Plan Data Set you wish to import</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once these three values are populated, all opportunities that were saved in the PDS will appear in the Opportunity Selection window.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3>Selecting Opportunities</h3>
        </p>
        <p>To choose which opportunities to import, simply check the box next to the opportunity name. In addition to the select/deselect all buttons, there is the option to multi-select. This is done by multi-selecting the desired opportunities (ctrl+click or shift+click), and pressing the space bar on your keyboard. This can be useful when wanting to only import projects which do not already exist in esi.manage. </p>
        <p>There is also the option to alphabetize either column in the list by clicking on the columnheader (ie. "Opportunity" or "Project Exists in esi.manage"), or searching for opportunities which contain a specific string by typing into the "Enersight Opportunity Search" field.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Run Enersight Import Job</h3>
        <p>Once the Enersight Import Job is configured and at least one opportunity has been selected, click the "Run Enersight Import Job" button <img src="../Images/Enersight Int Images/EN_run_import_job_button.png" /> to import the opportunities into esi.manage.</p>
