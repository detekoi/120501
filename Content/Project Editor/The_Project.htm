        <h1>The Project</h1>
        <p>The Project is how esi.manage encapsulates an <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead class="popupspot">Activity</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody class="popupBody_1">Expenditures</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> 
 and the corresponding <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead class="popupspot">Outcome</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody class="popupBody_1">Production, Reserves Adds, Operating Expenses</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup>. 
 The <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead class="popupspot">Asset</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody class="popupBody_1">Well, Facility, Cost Center</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> 
 is how the various <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead class="popupspot">Measures</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody class="popupBody_1">Expenditures, Production, Reserves, Operating Expenses</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> 
 are tied together within the Project.</p>
        <p>During the Budgeting process, this encapsulation allows Projects to 
 be compared - Performance or Economic Metrics can be calculated for the 
 Projects of interest and the relative performance evaluated.</p>
        <p>In addition, a Project also contains a Hierarchy - business process 
 information (Geographic Region, Asset Team) that allows a Project to be 
 reported on appropriately.</p>
        <p>There is a Life Cycle to a Project, represented by the combination of 
 the Project Status as well as the types of data that is contained within 
 the Project. The following list indicates how a Project can progress - 
 it is not required that a Project moves through every phase listed below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Long 
 Range Plan</span> - an Activity that is possible/planned for some time 
 in the future.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Planned</span> 
 - a Project that is part of the current year's Budget. The Project data 
 type is Forecast - what is expected to happen in terms of Expenditures 
 and Production, Reserves and Operating Expenses.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In 
 Progress</span> - once a Project's activities begin, the Progress can 
 be tracked by entering Actuals (Field Estimates, Actuals, etc.) against 
 the various measures.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Complete</span> 
 - when all of the activities are completed, and the Production is On-Stream, 
 Production and OPEX Actuals can continue to be tracked. The Asset (well) 
 is now part of the Base Production in future years.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>esi.manage provides the ability to apply Risk against the Forecast numbers. 
 For Expenditures, Risk is represented by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Probability 
 of Doing</span> - the likelihood that the Expenditure is going to occur. 
 For Production, Reserves and Operating Expenses, Risk is represented by 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Probability of Success</span> - the 
 likelihood of realizing the Outcome. Typically, the Probability of Success 
 is based on historical information - i.e., in a certain region new wells 
 are successful 85% of the time. </p>
        <p>Within the Project itself, Risk is entered on the <a href="../Dependencies/Dependency_Overview.htm">Dependencies</a> page. 
 It is beyond the Project boundaries where the impact of Risk becomes evident:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal 
 Targets</span> - Reporting or Ranking using a Risked basis reflects the 
 likely outcome at the end of the Year for a group of Projects. Most will 
 be successful, some won't. The Risked Forecast values represent the historical 
 success.</li>
            <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comparing 
 Projects</span> - in most cases, Projects should be compared on both an 
 Unrisked as well as Risked basis. While a Project may have a higher upside, 
 it may also come with a higher degree of Risk. </li>
        </ul>
