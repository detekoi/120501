        <h1>Patterns</h1>
        <p>The first step of making existing Type Curves usable is to create Patterns in the project-of-choice. Patterns are created by taking an existing Type Curve and apply modifiers to the Type Curve in order to manipulate the start date, magnitudes of the curve values, and any repeating of the Type Curve. </p>
        <p>There are two types of Patterns: Production and Expenditures. A Production Pattern can contain a primary Production Type Curve, as well as multiple secondary Type Curves (which can be Production or Royalty Type Curves). An Expenditure Pattern only contains a primary Expenditure Type Curve.</p>
        <p>In order to create Patterns, there must be existing Type Curves under the budget where the project-of-choice resides. For this example, the following Type Curves are created for the example budget (the Type Curve names describes the actual types). </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/TypeCurves2_Patterns_1.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To create Patterns, create or open an existing project in the budget where the Type Curves are created, and navigate through the Project Editor to find the tab named "Type Curves". Click the tab to open the page.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve2.png" style="width: 1329px;height: 697px;" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Create a new Pattern by selecting the 'Add Pattern' button on the left side of the page. A new Pattern with the default name "New Pattern" appears in the table on the left side. Double click on the name to re-name the new Pattern. For this example, two new Patterns are created (named "Production Pattern" and "Expenditure Pattern").</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>With the new Pattern selected/highlighted, select the 'Add Detail' button on the right side of the page. New items appear in the first row of the table on the right side. The caution symbol reminds the user to assign a Primary Type Curve to the Pattern.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The user can specify the following details for the new Pattern:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Primary Type Curve</b>: this is an existing Type Curve that is either a Compound Production&#160;Type Curve or an Expenditure Type Curve. This is the only required detail for a Pattern to be created, and must be specified before the Secondary Type Curve.</li>
            <li><b>Secondary Type Curve</b>: this is an existing Type Curve that is either a Derived Production Type Curve or a Royalty Type Curve. This is only applicable if the Primary Type Curve is a Compound Production Type Curve.</li>
            <li><b>Delay</b> (days): this value specifies the start date of the Pattern curve, by assigning the number of days into the future (of the current date). A negative value can be assigned to make the start date some time in the past.</li>
            <li><b>Scale</b>: this value is a multiplier to the magnitudes of the values that comprises the Pattern curve. </li>
            <li><b>Count</b>: this integer value specifies the number of times the Type Curves in the Pattern would appear. For count values greater than 1, the Type Curve would simply appear consecutively, with the time duration of the curve extended accordingly.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Primary Type Curve</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">To assign a Primary Type Curve, double click on the Primary Type Curve cell, and a dropdown menu listing the existing Type Curves eligible to be Primary Type Curves appears. For this example, the Type Curve named "Compound Production TC 1" is selected as a Primary Type Curve for "Production Pattern".</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve4.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The resulting 'Production Pattern' curve is an unmodified 'Compound Production TC 1' curve:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve5.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Secondary Type Curve</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">To assign a Secondary Type Curve, double click on the Secondary Type Curve cell, and a dropdown menu listing the existing Type Curves eligible to be Secondary Type Curves appears. For this example, the Type Curves named "Derived Production TC 1" and "Royalty TC" are selected as Secondary Type Curves for "Production Pattern".</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_Type_curve6.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The resulting 'Production Pattern' curve is an unmodified 'Compound Production TC 1' curve paired with an unmodified 'Derived Production TC 1' curve, which represents a gas by-product that is dependent on the oil production from 'Compound Production TC 1'.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve7.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">From this point on, modifiers are applied to customize the base Pattern curves created from adding the Primary and Secondary Type Curves.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Delay</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">For a new Pattern, the default start date of the curve is the date when the details of the Pattern are added. To specify a start date different from the current day, whether it is from the past or the future, a delay can be applied to change it to a desired start date. The delay value is the number of days to add or subtract from the default start date to shift to the desired start date. For this example, 'Production Pattern' was created on July 3, 2014 as shown in the screen shot above. In order to set the start date to June 3, 2014, a delay of -30 is entered to the delay cell (June 3, 2014 is 30 days prior to July 3, 2014).  </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Before delay:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/TypeCurves2_Patterns_9.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">After delay:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/TypeCurves2_Patterns_10.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Scale</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The new Pattern curve inherits the Production or Expenditure values from the Primary and Secondary Type Curves added to the Pattern. While the overall shapes of the Pattern curves as inherited from the Type Curves cannot be modified, the magnitudes of values in the Pattern curves can be changed as a whole by applying a scaling factor. The scaling factor (the user-defined number entered in the scale cell) is a multiplier to all values in the Pattern curves. This effectively keeps the curve the same while multiples all values in the y-axis of the curve by the scaling factor (however, the appearance of the curve may change due to changes in the y-axis range). The Pattern curves can be scaled in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Scaled up by applying a scaling factor greater than 1</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Scaled down by applying a scaling factor less than 1</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Leave unchanged by leaving the scaling factor at 1 (default value)</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">For this example, when the scaling factor is set at the default value of 1, the oil production of 'Production Pattern' starts at 100 bbl/d, and ends at 50 bbl/d:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve10.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">When the scaling factor is changed from 1 to 3, the initial oil production triples to 300 bbl/d, and the final oil production also triples to 150 bbl/d:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve11.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Count</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">At this point, with the Primary Type Curve, Secondary Type Curve, delay, and scale applied, the  result is an intermediate Pattern curve that contain single instances of the customized Primary Type Curve and Secondary Type Curves that begins and ends at the Primary Type Curve duration boundaries. The duration of the Pattern curve can be extended further by applying the count, which is a multiplier value for the number of consecutive times the intermediate Pattern curve is repeated. For this example, a count of 2 is applied to show the effect of the count modifier.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Before count is applied (default count of 1 is kept):</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve12.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">After count of 2 is applied:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve13.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Type Curve Dependencies </h3>
        <p>The user can also specify “dependencies” between different Primary Type Curves within a Pattern,  Similar to dependencies of true measures, Primary Type Curves can be assigned dependency relationships such that a Type Curve would not begin until the end of the preceding Type Curve.  Also similar to true measures dependencies, dependencies can be established between the two different types of Primary Type Curves (Production and Expenditure).</p>
        <p>The Type Curve dependencies are specified using the following four buttons (only applicable to Patterns with multiple Primary Type Curves):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move Up:  the selected Primary Type Curve switches position with the Primary Type Curve immediately above (does not apply to the first Primary Type Curve in the list)</li>
            <li>Move Down:  the selected Primary Type Curve switches position with the Primary Type Curve immediately below (does not apply to the last Primary Type Curve in the list)</li>
            <li>Move Left:  the selected Primary Type Curve loses dependency on the Primary Type Curve immediately above (does not apply to the first Primary Type Curve on the list, or any Primary Type Curve not already dependent on another)</li>
            <li>Move Right:  the selected Primary Type Curve gains dependency on the Primary Type Curve immediately above (does not apply to the first Primary Type Curve on the list)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Move Up and Move Down changes the order of the Primary Type Curve listing in a Pattern, Move Left and Move Right changes (turns on/off) the dependency relationship between Primary Type Curves.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve14.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <p>For this example, the Pattern “Dependency Pattern” consist of two Primary Type Curves that are not dependent on each other.  When the first Primary Type Curve (Expenditure TC) is selected, only the Move Down option is available:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <img src="../../Images/TypeCurvesOverviewFigure2.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <p>When the second Primary Type Curve (Compound Production TC 1) is selected, both the Move Up and Move Right options are available:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve16.png" style="width: 1447px;height: 225px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <p>Before any dependencies are established for “Dependency Pattern”, the Pattern curve has the following appearance.  Note that both Primary Type Curves begins on the same date.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve17.png" style="width: 1299px;height: 563px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <p>To make “Compound Production TC 1” depend on the end date of “Expenditure TC”, select the “Compound Production TC 1” Primary Type Curve, and then select Move Right.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve18.png" style="width: 1240px;height: 162px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <p>This action results in an indentation to be applied to “Compound Production TC 1”, and in the Pattern curve, the production curves are shifted to start at the end of the “Expenditure TC” curve.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <img src="../../Images/_type_curve19.png" style="width: 1346px;height: 583px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <h3>Other Modifiers</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The user can also specify the Reserve Consolidation of the Compound Production Type Curve used to generate the Pattern curve, if different curves are created within different Reserve Consolidations of the same Compound Production Type Curve. In the case of the example, only the "TestInc - 1P" Consolidation contains a Compound Production Type Curve, therefore it must be set at that Consolidation.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">If royalty is applied to the Production Pattern as a Secondary Type Curve, the following must be done:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Select a Price Scenario where the Royalty Type Curve has assigned royalties to</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Check the 'Apply Royalty' box</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">For this example, the Royalty Type Curve included as a Secondary Type Curve has a 20% royalty for oil under the "Royalty - Medium" Price Scenario. With "Royalty - Medium" and 'Apply Royalty" selected, the resulting 'Production Pattern' curve has a 20% drop in production compared to previous.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/TypeCurves2_Patterns_15.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Expenditure Pattern Example</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Creating an Expenditure Pattern follows the same procedure as creating a Production Pattern, except that only the Primary Type Curve, delay, scale, and count are necessary. Secondary Type Curves, Reserve Consolidation, Price Scenario, and royalty settings are unnecessary when creating an Expenditure Pattern. Below is an example of an Expenditure Pattern curve:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_expenditure_typecurve.png" style="width: 1000px;height: 433px;" />
        </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Removing Patterns</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">To remove a Pattern, select an existing Pattern at the left table, and select the 'Remove Pattern' button. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_remove_typecurve.png" style="width: 1086px;height: 115px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Before removing a Pattern, first ensure it is not currently used in a Recurrence, otherwise an error will occur:</p>
