        <h1>Type Curves Overview</h1>
        <p>Once Type Curves are created in the Project Perspective (see <a href="../../Project Perspective/Type Curves/TypeCurves_Overview.htm">Type Curves Overview</a>) for a budget, they can be used within each project in the budget. Existing Type Curves are used to create custom Production or Expenditure Patterns, in which the start date, scaling factor, and repeats are applied. Recurrences can then be created using existing Patterns, which could be used in place of data normally entered into the Production and Expenditures tabs of the Project Editor. The resulting Recurrences can be analyzed using Production Analysis and Expenditures Analysis. Therefore, Type Curves allow users to generate Production and Expenditures patterns that can be quickly applied across multiple projects for analysis purposes, without the need to create each Production and Expenditure individually.</p>

        <p>As shown in the screen shot, Type Curves are found under the 'Type Curves' tab in the Project Editor for each project.</p>
        <p>This section pertains to the functionality of the Type Curves tab in the Project Editor, which focuses on the application of Type Curves. For the functionality of the Type Curves tab in the Project Perspective, which focuses on the creating of Type Curves, refer to <a href="../../Project Perspective/Type Curves/TypeCurves_Overview.htm">Type Curves Overview.</a></p>
