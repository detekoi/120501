        <p>The <a href="../../Integration Perspective/Integration_Perspective_Overview.htm">Integration Perspective</a> is where External Identifiers (EIDs) are 
 mapped to Assets. External Identifiers are used by the various Imports 
 to provide a Map between an External Identifier (how an Asset is identified 
 in another system) and the corresponding esi.manage Asset.</p>
        <p>As there may be a significant number of EID records, a mechanism is 
 provided to streamline the process. By starting from the particular Asset 
 that you wish to Map, or change Mapping for, the Integration Perspective 
 can be configured to show the information that you need. Note that the 
 following process only initializes the Integration Perspective. You can 
 use the full Filtering and Searching capabilities within the Integration 
 Perspective to see the entire set if desired.</p>
        <p>When you select this button, a Wizard will open:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_eid_view.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Select an Appropriate Project Set that contains the Project(s) that 
 you will be working with.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_eid_prop.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Choose the System(s) and whether you wish to see Mapped or Unmapped 
 EID's. When you enter the Integration Perspective from via this route:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_eid_page.png" style="width: 1251px;height: 561px;" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The view will be initialized to the Asset (upper right) that was selected 
 (from the Project). This full list of Assets (upper left table) will be 
 those that are associated with Projects based on your Project Set selection. 
 The External Identifiers list (bottom) will be those that matched the 
 criteria - in this case PVR and Qbyte, and are Unmapped.</p>
