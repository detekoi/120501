        <h1>Shrinkage</h1>
        <p>Shrinkage, along with production volumes and downtime are entered in 
 the production editor screen.</p>
        <p>Click on the Shrinkage tab at the top of the upper table in the production 
 editor screen.</p>

        <p>Once the shrinkage tab is opened, a shrinkage percentage can be added 
 by product for each different asset that has associated production. The 
 table supports right click copy and paste functions, so values can easily 
 be pasted in from excel.</p>
        <p>The table also supports a toggle between monthly and annual periods.</p>
        <p>The Shrinkage % represents 'losses' which may be due to Derived Product(s), 
 line losses, or consumption for compression. This factor is represented 
 in Production Calculations via the Raw versus Sales Production definition.
 </p>
        <p>Please see '<a href="Derived_Products.htm">Derived Products 
 Calculations</a>' for how shrinkage affects derived product calculations.
