        <h1>Production Chart &amp; Reserve Summary</h1>
        <p>The view in the lower right hand pane of the production editor contains 
 the Production Chart, the Reserve Summary, and the S-Curve.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The production chart is a graphical production decline curve and enables 
 the data that has been entered to be seen in terms of the data consolidations 
 defined in Configuration.</li>
            <li>This provides an "on the go" picture of the resulting decline curve without 
 having to run a production analysis or production report.</li>
            <li>Any of the Consolidations can be shown either as a Daily Rate or Cumulative.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>By right clicking on the chart, you can: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Change the scale from Linear to Logarithmic.</li>
            <li>Change the data from daily rate to cumulative</li>
            <li>Show all products</li>
            <li>Remove or add the reserve consolidations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Reserve summary tab provides a snapshot of both the technical 
 and economic reserves by Reserve Category, Consolidation and product. 
 The Reserve units are set in the <a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Budget-Project/Budget.htm">Configuration 
 perspective&gt;Budget /Project&gt;Budgets</a> and you will see a column 
 called 'Reserve unit'.</li>
            <li>This provides an 'on the go' and conveniently placed summary of the 
 resulting reserves without having to run a report or view the reserves 
 tab in the production editor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The S-Curve tab chart is a graphical curve that represents the Cumulative Probability Curve that can be produced and the probability that a certain volume will be present.</li>
            <li>For each of these cumulative volumes, a production profile is then defined where the area under the production curve is equal to the volume. It is these production curves associated with the P10, P50, and P90 (or any other point on the volume curve that has been selected) that are stored in the S-Curve tab.<br /></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The S-Curve chart can toggle the display of Classifications and Consolidations by right-clicking and choosing what will be shown.</p>
