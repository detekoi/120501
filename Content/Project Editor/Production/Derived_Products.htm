        <h1>Derived Products</h1>
        <p>Derived Products is a mechanism for defining a Production segment (the 
 Derived Product) as a Ratio to another Production segment (the Primary 
 Product). There are several aspects of the model which should be considered 
 when creating a Derived Segment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullets">A Derived Segment is associated 
 against an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Asset</span>, and defined 
 in terms of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary Product</span>.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">The Ratio applies to 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> Production segments of the 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary Product</span>, which are associated 
 with the same <span style="font-weight: bold;">Asset</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrinkage</span> 
 for the Primary Product segment(s) dictates <span style="font-weight: bold;">when</span> 
 the Derived Product's production is reported.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets">Shrinkage &gt; 0 - 
 the Derived Product's production is only reported for <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Budget-Project/Production_Definitions.htm">Sales Definitions</a></span>.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">Shrinkage = 0 - the 
 Derived Product's production is reported for all Production Definitions. 
 </li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets">There are two Ratio models:</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed</span> 
 - the Ratio does not change with time. &#160;This 
 can be achieved by entering a single ratio into the derived production 
 ratio table, and selecting Constant interpolation.</li>
                <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable</span> 
 - there is a time series of Ratios that can be created. This is done by 
 entering &gt;1 ratio in the derived production ratio table.</li>
                <li class="Bullets">Note that Shrinkage 
 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not time-variant</span>, using the 
 Variable Ratio model with a non Zero shrinkage can present numerical differences 
 when comparing results generated with different Definitions.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets">There are two types of 
 Derived Products</li>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;list-style-type: circle;" type="disc">
                <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">By-product</span> 
 - a secondary product derived from the primary product, which is affected 
 by the primary products shrinkage. &#160;By-products 
 will always have zero<br />		Gross "unshrunk" production. &#160;By-products 
 will not appear in Production analysis unless Production definition is 
 "shrunk".</li>
                <li class="Bullets"><b>Associated 
 product</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> - A production stream that 
 is derived as a ratio from another stream, and is unrelated to the primary 
 products shrinkage. &#160;Associated 
 products<br />		can have non-zero gross "unshrunk" production.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>The onstream date of the derived product can be controlled in two ways with the use of the <b>Start Event</b> parameter:</li>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;list-style-type: circle;" type="disc">
                <li class="Bullets"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Onstream</span> 
				- The start date for production will be the related to the onstream date of the primary product. Variation to the onstream date of the primary product can be achieved through the use of the offset. </li>
                <li class="Bullets"><b>Calendar</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> - The onstream date of the derived production will start on the date specified in the field <b>Start Date</b>. Note that offsets still apply and will reference the <b>Start Date</b></span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li class="Bullets">Defaults</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>
                    <p>Use Defaults? toggle can be used to automatically fill the derived product ratio(s) based on defaults that are set against a hierarchy element (eg. Region) in the Configuration.</p>
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: normal;">See the <a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Defaults/Production_Defaults.htm">Defaults</a> section for more information 
 on setting derived production defaults in the Configuration section.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="Bullets" style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
        <p>The Variable model is designed for situations where you want to report 
 Yield, which may change over time with facility upgrades. In most situations, 
 the Fixed model is appropriate and should be configured at a Ratio consistent 
 with the Primary Product's shrinkage.</p>

        <h3>Creating A New Production Segment with a Derived 
 Product(s)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Create the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary Segment</span> - in the screen shot 
 below this is the Gas segment.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">For the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Derived Segment</span> - select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Asset</span> 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Product,</span> and choose the Decline 
 Type as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Derived</span>. The derived product 
 line will appear in green font.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Select the Production Rate units for the Derived Segment. This selection does not specify how the Ratio will be defined.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">esi.manage supports 
 the creation of one derived product from another derived Product, for 
 example defining Gas as a Ratio to the Primary Oil production, and then 
 Deriving Condensate from the Gas derived segment. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Click away from 
 the derived header line and then click back into it to access the derived 
 details pane in the bottom left hand corner.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_derived_products.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In order to define the ratio(s), select the row you want to edit, the 
 details will show up in the bottom left pane.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/_derived_products2.png" style="width: 411px;height: 292px;" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are two approaches to defining the Ratio - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed</span> 
 or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable</span>. </p>
        <p>A Fixed Ratio is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">single value</span> 
 that will be applied to any Production of the Primary product, for the 
 Asset.</p>
        <p>If Shrinkage has been specified on the Primary Segment - the Ratio should 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">likely be consistent</span> with Shrinkage, 
 in terms of the Units Conversions in your database. </p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Variable Model</h3>
        <p>As described previously, the Variable model is designed for situations 
 where you want to represent Yield changes.</p>
        <p>

        <ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="NumberedList">A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable 
 Ratio</span> is a time series of Fixed Ratio's.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Offset defines 
 when changes in the model occur. The 0 entry (shown above) would indicate 
 the starting Ratio.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">The Interpolation 
 method defines the shape of the ratio curve between two successive entries.</li>
