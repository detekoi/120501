        <h1>S-Curves</h1>
        <p>S-Curves, along with production volumes and shrinkage, are entered in the production editor screen.</p>
        <p>Click on the S-Curve tab at the top of the upper table in the production editor screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/SCurves1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The S-Curve editor models the S-Curve by entering tabular data as a tabular cumulative probability.</p>
        <p>The screen is split into two areas.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The left section of the S-Curve editor contains the S-Curve details. The Asset, Product, and Unit are selected to be associated with the probability values. The table below is where amounts can be associated with a specific probability percent.</li>
            <li>The right section contains the associated chart driving from the amounts and probabilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The S-Curve can only be input as tabular cumulative probability vs volume curve</li>
            <li>Each product will have a separate S-Curve but must use the same cumulative probability points</li>
            <li>Derived products do not have S-Curves, only primary products</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Append an S-Curve to the volume profile of a product</h3>
        <p>To append an S-Curve to the volume profile of a product, the steps are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the Asset, Product and Unit.<br /><img src="../../Images/SCurves3.png" /></li>
            <li>Enter the cumulative volume in the first column and the cumulative probability in the second column.<br />(This function is supported by copy and paste from Excel)</li>
            <li>If the data inserted is not cumulative, a warning <img src="../../Images/SCurves4.png" /> will display indicated that "Amounts/Probability must be in order". Enter data in the correct order and the symbol will disappear.<br /><img src="../../Images/SCurves5.png" /></li>
            <li>As you enter cumulative volumes and probability into the S-Curves editor pane, the chart in the right pane will automatically draw the completed curves.  This curve does not take any capacity or downtime into effect when it is drawn, but instead gives you an instant visualization of the curve you are creating.<br /><img src="../../Images/SCurves6.png" /></li>
        </ol>
