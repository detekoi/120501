        <h1>Time Variant Quality</h1>
        <p>Product Quality can be entered over time on the production editor page. 
 This allows for modelling a change in quality of products as conditions 
 in the well change over time.</p>
        <p>Click on the Quality tab at the top of the upper table in the Production 
 editor screen.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once the Quality tab is opened, the product quality and quality unit 
 can be entered for each production stream on each asset. The Quality that 
 is entered will have an effect on Pricing and Revenue calculations, as 
 higher qualities tend to have higher price values associated with them. </p>
        <p>The table also supports a toggle between monthly and annual periods. </p>
