The top panel displays the Economic Limit Dates, as well as both the Technical and Economic Gross Reserves.  This information is displayed for every reserve consolidation you have set up in the configuration screen.  Some of the rows may have blank cells, and this is most likely because there is either a) no production associated with that consolidation or b) operational expenditures do not exceed the revenue generated at any point so the production stream is not truncated.</strong>

        <p><strong style="font-weight: normal;">Technical Gross </strong>Reserves 
 are automatically calculated from the production forecast data entered

If at no point an average daily production rate is encountered that is greater than the reference rate, then there is no Economic Limit Date (ie. it is uneconomic).

        <h3>Reserve Booking Schedule </h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The bottom left panel is the Reserve Booking Schedule.   The percentages entered here determine what percentage of the forecasted production will be booked as Reserves at a given time.  This can be time variant, so that only a portion of the Reserves needs to be booked at a time, allowing for readjustments based on the actual production stream.  This schedule allows for a Reserve Progression to be modelled over time, which can then be reported on.</span>
        </p>
        <p>The Reserves can be booked annually, or monthly, by selecting the "Change Tabular Periodicity" button <img src="../../Images/change_tabular_period.PNG" style="border: none;float: none;width: 21px;height: 21px;border-style: none;" width="21" height="21" border="0" />. &#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">There is also the option to enter percentages as a total % of Reserves (eg. 50% Year 1, 80% Year 2, 100% Year 3) , or as the % change for the period (eg. 50% Year 1, 30% Year 2, 20% Year 3), by clicking </span><img src="../../Images/sigma.png" style="border: none;width: 19px;height: 20px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="19" height="20" border="0" />. 
 &#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">This 
 can be toggled back and forth after values are entered, and the values 
 will be converted for you.</span></p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">These values need to be filled out for 
 the Economic Limit Date to be calculated.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The percentages you enter in the booking 
 column will determine the percentage of the "expected value" 
 reserves you will book. &#160;The 
 expected value is denoted in the configuration, on the <a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Budget-Project/Reserve_Classifications.htm">Reserve 
 Classifications</a> page, by a gold star <img src="../../Images/expected_value.png" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;" border="0" />. &#160;The 
 percentages you enter in the Progression columns will determine the percentage 
 of the reserves/production entered in each respected reserve classification 
 that is no longer in that classification. &#160;See 
 below for an example using the following screenshots as settings.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When the previous settings are applied, with the total production values shown above, the following picture is an image of the Reserve Bookings over time.</p>
        <p>At the present day, the Reserve Bookings for 1P = Total Gross Reserves * % Reserves Booked * reserve weighting = 100,000 * 50% * 1.0 = 50,000.</p>
        <p>The Reserve Bookings for P2 = P2 Reserves * % Reserves Booked * reserve weight= 50,000 * 50% * 0.7 = 17,500</p>
        <p>The Reserve Bookings for P3 = P3 Reserves * % Reserves Booked * reserve weight= 50,000 * 50% * 0.3 = 7,500</p>
        <p>In the chart the layers are stacked, and each Reserve classifications contribution to the total Reserve bookings for that year are represented by the area of the chart that is the corresponding color.  This means that the light yellow shaded color on top is 7,500, and the orange area in the middle is 17,500.  Combine these with the 50,000 on the bottom, and the total booked reserves in year one is 75,000.  The total Reserves Booked each year should equal the Expected Value multiplied by the Booking percentage.</p>
        <p>Notice the increase in Year 2, where P1 Reserve bookings increase to 75,000, according to the Booking Schedule in Year 2, and up to 100,000 (the total Technical Reserves) when the Booking Schedule is 100%.  The same progress occurs for P3 (accounting for Reserve Classification weighting, of course).</p>
        <p>In Year 3, all Reserves are booked 100%, and the total is the Expected Value (Swanson’s Mean).  In each of the previous years the total is also equal to the Expected Value, multiplied by the booking schedule.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/prod12.PNG" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Reserves Progression and Reserve Booking Schedules should not both be used at the same time, except where the Reserve Booking Schedule is 100% in Year 1.</p>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Reserve Progression</h3>
        <p>The Reserve Progression is, in short, the percentage of the Reserves in that Classification that is no longer in that Classification after that period, but instead has become Proven (ie. 1P).  In order to set up a Reserve Progression, a few things must be done already.  There must be an EV consolidation set in the Reserve Category that you are using, and there must not be a NULL value in the weightings for that Consolidation.  Every Classification must be accounted for.  This means that a typical EV if using a Reserve Progression is a Swanson’s Mean.  Notice that the weightings below are for incremental Classifications (P1, P2, P3).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/prod10.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/prod13.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/prod11.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>According to the chart shown below, it should be easy to recognize that the amounts that each Reserve Classification is contributing to the total (Swanson’s Mean, the Expected Value) in Y1 is equal to the total reserves in that classification multiplied by its weight.  For example, 50,000 in P2 * 0.7 weight = 35,000.</p>
        <p>In Y2 and later, however, the amount contributed by P2 and P3 are reduced as their Reserves are being progressed into P1.  Eventually all Reserves will have been progressed from P2 and P3 into P1, and P1 will be equal to the Swanson’s Mean, 150,000.  As Reserves progress through the Classifications, the total should remain constant.  That is to say that if you multiply the Reserves in the Classifications by their respective weights at any time, you should always arrive at 150,000.  Over time, the proportion of the total that is contributed by each Classification is what changes.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/prod14.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In the chart, the numbers are written so that the values are easily seen and vertical lines are drawn to separate the years.  The total for each year is 150,000, equal to the Expected Value.  The values entered in each colored section refer to the amount of reserves contributed to the total that are in that classification for that given year.</p>
        <p>In Reserve Progression P1 does not have any Reserves progressing out, and P3 does not have any Reserves progressing in.  There is 100% progression in Y3, but in the chart there still remains some Reserves in P2.  This is because the Reserves only progress a single Classification at a time, and in Y3 the last Reserves from P3 are progressed into P2.  These cannot be progressed to P1 until Y4.</p>
        <p>A brief explanation of the two most important points in the Reserve Progression calculations are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The total Reserves progressed out of a particular Reserve Classification in a single period</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>
                        <p>ReservesP3: The starting total Reserves volume for the period, for the designated Classification</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>b.	Progression %P3: The Reserve Progression percentage for the period, for the designated Classification</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p style="text-align: center;">OutP3=ReservesP3 X Progression %P3</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The total Reserves added to a particular Reserve Classification in a single period can be calculated using the following formula.</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>
                        <p>OutP2: Total Reserves progressed out of the source Classification</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>WP2: weighting of the Reserve Consolidation for the source Classification</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>WP1: weighting of the Reserve Consolidation for the destination Classification</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/prod15.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Using the previous two calculations, and the information entered into esi.manage, you can manually calculate the Reserve Progression from start to finish.  It is important to remember that you progress the lower (P2 is lower than P3) Reserves first in any given period.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Reserves Progression and Reserve Booking Schedules should not both be used at the same time, except where the Reserve Booking Schedule is 100% in Year 1.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reserve 
 reporting</span>
        </h3>
        <p>Any report that involves Production or OPEX in a calculation (includes Sales, Reserves and Project Summaries) allows the user to report against consolidated reserves. This means that the reserve data can be reported for different classes of reserves (reserves, contingent reserves etc) and also for the different consolidations of reserves that have been configured (P10, 50 , 90, mean, Swanson etc).</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../../Images/prod16.PNG" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" border="0" /></span></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> the Report will use the selected Consolidation for the calculations. 
 For Variance Reports, you can use two different Consolidations.</p>
        <p>An option is available on any Report that involves Production or Reserves, 
 called Reserve Progression. &#160;Depending 
 on your configuration of Reserves, this toggle may or may not have an 
 effect. &#160;This 
 is intended to be used so that if you have a Reserve Consolidation that 
 is an expected value, you are able to report on the progression of the 
 Reserves from the Reserve Consolidation you choose in the Report Parameters 
 to the expected value, over time.</p>
        <p>There is another option available to select whether to use either the Economic or Calculated Reserve Variant.  This refers to whether or not the Production should be truncated at either the Asset Economic Limit Date or Calculated for the individual case.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
