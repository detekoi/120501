            <li><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</strong> 
 Project Name.</li>
            <li><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Code:</strong> 
 If a project code was assigned when the project was added, this will be 
 reflected here.</li>
            <li><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Status:</strong> 
 Reflects the stage the project is at. Default options include Approved, 
 Budgeted, Completed, In Progress, Inventory, and Proposed.</li>
            <li><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Manager:</strong> 
 The assigned project manager for the&#160;project.&#160;This can be changed 
 by selecting a new manager from the "Project Manager"&#160;pick 
 list&#160;in the second&#160;column of fields in the editor below.&#160;The 
 Project Manager is the main security level, and largely determines the visibility and ability of users to read and/or write to
 the project. See the <a href="../../Configuration Perspective/System/User_Project_Manager_Access.htm">User/Project Manager Access</a> page for more details on using Project Managers to control security, or the <a href="../../Configuration Perspective/System/Roles.htm">User Roles</a> section for more details on access rights.</li>
            <li><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Location:</strong> 
 Text field for the geographical position of the project.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Template

 Projects will be created, either individually or as Assets grouped by 
 year.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source 
 Template</span>: if the Project is a Virtual Project, this indicates the 
 Source Template project.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start 
 Date</span>: the earliest Start Date within the Project.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Created

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Created 
 Time</span>: Log of when the project was initially generated.</li>
            <li><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Comment: 
 <span style="font-weight: normal;">Text</span></strong> field for any 
 extra information that should be noted about the project that was not 
 included in the standard fields.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A Projects Start Date is used in several places throughout esi.manage, 
 such as:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Template Scheduler</li>
            <li>Date Shifting</li>
            <li>"Earliest Date" in Economics</li>
            <li>Integration with esi.schedule</li>
            <li>Clone Asset</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The logic used to determine the Start Date for a Project is outlined 
 below. &#160;An 
 asset's start date is taken to be the earliest date from among the following 
 items:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>CAPEX header and detail start dates</li>
            <li>AFE detail start dates</li>
            <li>production forecast onstream dates</li>
            <li>production non-forecast detail start dates</li>
            <li>If none of these dates are present, the asset's 
 start date is taken to be the containing budget's start date.</li>
            <li>OPEX, spud, rig release, ownership, reserve booking 
 dates and any other dates are all expressly ignored for this calculation.</li>
            <li>A project's start date is the earliest of its 
 assets' start dates.</li>
            <li>If a project has no assets, then its start date 
 is the containing budget's start date.</li>
        </ul>
