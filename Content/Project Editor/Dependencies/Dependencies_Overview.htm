        <p>esi.manage includes a single-page mechanism to correlate multiple Measures 
 to one another in Dependent relationships. This is accomplished using 
 the Dependencies page tab under the Project View. The Dependencies page 
 tab allows single page entry of the correlations between Expenditure, 
 Production, Fixed OPEX and Resource Allocation.</p>
        <p>In the example below, each well has Drilling, Completion, and Equipment 
 &amp; Tie-in expenditures associated with it, and they are dependent on 
 each other so that an expenditure cannot begin until the previous expenditure 
 is completed.</p>

        <p>Dependencies 
 are not limited to merely expenditures, nor are they limited to be within 
 a single Asset. &#160;It 
 is possible for the expenditure of Asset 2 to be dependent on the completion 
 of production of Asset 1. &#160;In 
 this way you are able to model Daisy Chain Workovers, where the Workover 
 expenditure will begin after the calculated offstream date of a production 
 stream, and more production will continue after. &#160;See 
 an example below.</p>
