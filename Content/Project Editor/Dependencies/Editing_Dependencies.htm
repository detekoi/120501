        <p>To change the order of dependencies, users are able to link, and unlink, 
 measures from each other. &#160;There 
 are several ways to accomplish this, with click and drag being the simplest.</p>
        <p>Dependencies can also be linked/unlinked by dragging and dropping the 
 desired dependencies under the desired “Node”. When you click on a measure 
 and begin to drag, it will become transparent, and other measures that 
 you hover over will become highlighted.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The measure that is highlighted will be the parent measure to the measure 
 you are dragging. &#160;Releasing 
 the 40 - Oil production stream while the 40 - Workover measure is highlighted 
 will result in the following image.</p>

        <p>There are several other variables on the Dependency screen that can 
 be edited. &#160;For 
 more information on these, please see <a href="../../Dependencies/Dependencies.htm">Dependencies 
 and subtopics.</a> &#160;</p>
