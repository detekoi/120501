        <h1>Ownership Behaviour</h1>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>From the Ownership tab you can apply working interest 
 at two levels; the first is at the Project level, and the second is at 
 the Asset level.</li>
            <li>Working interest can also be applied through the 
 Ownership tab to CAPEX, Production, and OPEX individually or across all 
 the measures equally.</li>
            <li>The periodicity in the ownership table can be 
 toggled between yearly and monthly for added levels of detail for the 
 time-variant nature of working interest by clicking <img src="../../Images/ownership_calendar_button.png" style="border: none;float: none;" border="0" /></li>
            <li>The default working interest for the project is 
 100%, if any changes are made, this propagates to all levels below where 
 the change was made (unless manual entries are already made at the lower 
 levels)</li>
            <li>Any level that has been edited is marked with a small pencil icon. <img src="../../Images/Ownership Pencil Icon.PNG" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" border="0" /></li>
            <li>Any line that is in the process of being edited 
 will show an asterisk symbol beside the year being edited.</li>
        </ul>
