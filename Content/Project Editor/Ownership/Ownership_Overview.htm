        <h1>Ownership Overview</h1>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>The Ownership Tab provides the function to add 
 time-variant working interest.<img src="../../Images/Ownership Tab.PNG" style="border: none;width: 85px;height: 21px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="85" height="21" border="0" /></li>
            <li>The Ownership tab allows one to input WI% by project 
 or by asset (subset of a project) and for all measures or individually (Expenditure types, 
 Products or OPEX).</li>
            <li>By entering data into a cell, esi.manage will 
 automatically populate the subsequent months or years with the same number.</li>
            <li>WI% is inherited down the Ownership levels and 
 down the Measures. For example, if the project level had ownership configured, 
 the asset level would automatically inherit the WI% from the Project level 
 unless it was manually overwritten. Likewise, WI% configured in All Measures 
 would feed down to the other measures who would inherit the data. Inherited 
 WI% is denoted by a tinted shading in the WI% fields, see below.</li>
            <li>When data has been written to the ownership tables, 
 a pencil icon will appear. See below, next to Asset for example.</li>
            <li>Ownership can also be configured across multiple 
 projects that sit in the same hierarchy group. This is done in the <a href="../../Configuration Perspective/Defaults/Ownership.htm">default Ownership</a> page of the Configuration perspective.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: left;">

        </p>
        <p>In the screenshot above, there are several pieces of information can 
 be taken away from it besides the obvious meaning of the values shown.</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Because Bakken Base Well 1 is highlighted yellow, 
 its value is being inherited from the level above it. &#160;In 
 this case, the only level above Asset/All Measures is Project/All measures. 
 &#160;This means 
 that at the highest possible level, on the Project/All measures screen, 
 there is a value of 20% entered. &#160;If 
 you were to create a new asset then, it would automatically inherit this 
 20% WI%.</li>
            <li>There are no pencils next to the measures (Expenditure, 
 Fixed OPEX, Production), so you can assume that the values entered on 
 this page will be inherited by all the levels below it without being changed. 
 &#160;This means 
 that for each measure associated with each asset, it will have the WI% 
 displayed here for the asset it is associated with.</li>
        </ol>
