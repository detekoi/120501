        <h2>Price-Based Opex</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Price-Based Opex</b> is similar to Variable Opex, except that the schedule and currency are provided by the attached price profile.</p>
        <p>In essence, there are cases where a price can be tied to a production stream to account for gas being flared or steam being produced by purchased gas.</p>
        <p>For example, a product can be set up for Purchased Gas, and then a production stream created within a project for the amount of gas purchased for producing steam in an injector.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A Price-Based Opex can then be attached to that purchased gas to net the revenue to zero for that purchase. This is done by selecting the<b> Purchased Gas</b> product, associating it with and<b> Opex Type</b>, and attaching a <b>Price Profile</b>. The Price profile will assume a default if there is one associated with the product. If there is no default for the selected product, and no price profile selected, the Opex will be reported as 0.</p>
